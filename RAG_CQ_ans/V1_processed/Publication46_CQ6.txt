The context does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning the data. Normalization is the process of rescaling the data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling is the process of adjusting the range of the data to a specific scale, often between -1 and 1. Cleaning the data involves removing any missing or irrelevant data points. %Query
