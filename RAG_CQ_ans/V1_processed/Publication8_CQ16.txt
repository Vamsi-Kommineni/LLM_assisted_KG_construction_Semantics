The model was trained twice, once with a training subset of 498 images on a single GPU for 9000 iterations and performance evaluated on the test subset of 155 images, also on a single GPU and then trained again on all 653 annotated images on three GPUs for 18000 iterations for predicting plant organs on another un-annotated independent dataset to evaluate our method. This dataset consists of 708 full scale herbarium scans, with an average size of ca. 9600 by 6500 pixels, from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR) (Otte et al. 2011) with a different set of species (Fig. 2) and geographical origins, which is also available at GBIF (Senckenberg 2020). The Python code and the trained model have been made available at GitHub (Younis 2020). The criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the training was completed after a certain number of iterations, specifically 9000 iterations for the first training and 18000 iterations for the second training. The performance was then evaluated on the test subset and the un-annotated independent dataset, respectively.
