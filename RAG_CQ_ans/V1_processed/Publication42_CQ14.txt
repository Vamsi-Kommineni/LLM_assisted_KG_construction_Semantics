The hyperparameters of the model were optimized by using combinations of hyperparameters for the first and last layer in the CNN. The hyperparameters used to train different CNNs for species classification include fixed pool size and stride, kernel size, convolutional depth, fully connected size, and optimizer. The optimal chosen CNN architecture is shown in Figure 5, which uses a combination of these hyperparameters.
