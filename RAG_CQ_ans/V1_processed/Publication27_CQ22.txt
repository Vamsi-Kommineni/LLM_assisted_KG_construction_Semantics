The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
