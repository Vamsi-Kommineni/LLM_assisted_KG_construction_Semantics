The training process is performed for a number of iterations in which all the training data are exposed to the network until the loss function reaches its minimum value. In this case, the model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations with a NVIDIA Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores). The number of trainable parameters was 85,569 and the computational run-time was approximately 4 h with a training batch size of 1024.
