The generalizability of the deep learning model was tested by using a train set (4781 sites) for fitting all models and a test set (400 sites) for testing the models' generalization capacities. The performance metrics were calculated for each species and for the two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets of sites. The train and test metrics were then averaged over the 50 species.
