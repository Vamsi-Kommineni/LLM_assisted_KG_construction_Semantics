The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and false positive rate. These metrics are calculated using Python package sklearn and plotted using package matplotlib. Additionally, a confusion matrix is used to evaluate the taxonomic bias of the four networks using the package sklearn.
