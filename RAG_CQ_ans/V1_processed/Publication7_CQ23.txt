The paper mentions that the weights of the deep network were fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse dataset. Additionally, the paper describes three experiments conducted to evaluate the classifier, including training and testing on different subsets of the data, which could be considered a form of cross-validation. However, the paper does not explicitly mention stratified splitting.
