The deep learning model was trained with a diverse dataset that included thumbnails of whole fish, part of species, and environment. The model was also post-processed with decision rules to improve its performance. The model was tested on a set of thumbnails that were not included in the training dataset, and its performance was compared to that of human experts. The model was also evaluated using cross-validation and stratified splitting to ensure its generalizability.
