The postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the final layer of the model produces the prediction of presence or absence of biotic or anthropogenic sounds. The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and Cramer's V statistic. The context also mentions that the predicted number of seconds containing biotic and anthropogenic sound for each half-hour period was averaged over the week to produce average daily patterns of acoustic activity.
