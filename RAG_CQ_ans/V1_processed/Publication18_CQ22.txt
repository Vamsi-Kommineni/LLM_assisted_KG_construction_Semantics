The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the F1-measure (or F1-score), which is an index that evaluates the balance between precision and recall. The F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value (precision) and sensitivity (recall). The positive predictive value is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while sensitivity is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases.
