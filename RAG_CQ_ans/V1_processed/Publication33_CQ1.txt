The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. For instance, remote sensors such as satellites, drones, camera traps, or underwater cameras are used to record pictures or videos of aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Additionally, public datasets like Fish4Knowledge database and Seaclef challenge are used for ecological analysis.
