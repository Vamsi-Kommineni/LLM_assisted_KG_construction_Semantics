The deep learning pipeline uses image data format. The input images are resized to 300 × 300 resolution for the single-leaf classifier and 512 × 512 resolution for the semantic segmentation model. The segmentation model uses DeepLabv3+ with ResNet-101 as the feature extractor, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The single-leaf classifier uses a pre-trained VGG16 network, also trained on the ImageNet dataset. Both models are implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
