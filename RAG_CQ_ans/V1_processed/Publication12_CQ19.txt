The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow. The context provided does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention that models were trained in the GPU for the four networks, which suggests that a deep learning framework was used. TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework that supports GPU training, so it is a reasonable assumption that TensorFlow was used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, the helpful answer is: The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow.
