The paper mentions the use of data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and generalize better. Specifically, the python library imgaug is used for data augmentation of images and videos. The augmentation techniques used include horizontal flip. However, the paper does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
