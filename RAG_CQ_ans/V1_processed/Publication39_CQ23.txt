To prevent overfitting and to generalize better, different data augmentation techniques were utilized during the training process. The python library imgaug was used for the data augmentation of images and videos. For Mask R-CNN and FGFA, the same augmentation technique with identical parameters was applied to each frame of the video. The augmentation techniques used were horizontal flip, vertical flip, and rotation.
