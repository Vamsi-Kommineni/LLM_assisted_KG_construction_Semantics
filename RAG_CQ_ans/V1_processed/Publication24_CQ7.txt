The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. The split is often done randomly, but stratified sampling can also be used to ensure that the distribution of classes is similar in all sets.
