DeepLabv3+ is used for semantic segmentation tasks, such as identifying and segmenting individual leaves in herbarium sheet images. The model is pre- trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on the dataset. It uses an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and a batch size of 3. The model is trained for 100 epochs with a binary cross-entropy loss function as it is a binary class problem (leaf or background).
