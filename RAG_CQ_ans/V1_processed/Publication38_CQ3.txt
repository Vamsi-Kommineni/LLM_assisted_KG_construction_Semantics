The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Users were instructed to draw bounding boxes around the locations of bat calls within call sequences and to annotate them as being either: (1) search-phase echolocation calls; (2) terminal feeding buzzes; or (3) social calls. Users were also encouraged to annotate the presence of insect vocalisations and non-biotic mechanical noises.
