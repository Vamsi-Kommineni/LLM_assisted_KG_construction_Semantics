The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that field surveys and recordings are used to collect data for the study. The context mentions that the study uses distributional data and recent field surveys by RMB to generate a new dataset. Additionally, the study uses spectrograms, which are visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time, to train and test the classifier.
