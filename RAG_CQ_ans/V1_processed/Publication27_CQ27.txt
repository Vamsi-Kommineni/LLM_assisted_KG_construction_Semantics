The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved model serialization and platform selection. The model was serialized using the pickle library in Python, which allowed it to be saved and loaded as a binary file. The platform selected for deployment was AWS SageMaker, which provided a scalable and secure environment for hosting the model. The model was then deployed using the AWS SageMaker Python SDK, which allowed for easy integration with other AWS services.
