After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, generally, postprocessing steps can include calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix can help visualize the performance of the model. Saliency maps can also be used to understand which parts of the input data are most important for the model's predictions. %Query
