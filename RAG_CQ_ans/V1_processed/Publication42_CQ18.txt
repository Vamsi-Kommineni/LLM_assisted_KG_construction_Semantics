The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training was to use a validation set. The confusion matrix was based upon the validation of the chosen model, and it had a diagonal trend, which indicated that the model matched the validation set well. The model had a recall of 93%, indicating that only 7% of the moth species in the validation set were missed. A similar precision of 93% was obtained, indicating that only 7% were wrongly classified.
