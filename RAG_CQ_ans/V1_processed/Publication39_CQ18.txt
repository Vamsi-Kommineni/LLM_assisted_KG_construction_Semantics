The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a validation set. The validation set is used to evaluate the model performance after each epoch. The best model is selected based on the performance on the validation set. %Context Context: We split the annotated dataset AnnotationsActions (cf. Section 2. 2) randomly (but fixed for all experiments and all networks) into a train set, validation set and test set. The test set includes 20% of the video clips of each class. Of the remaining clips, again 20% of the clips in each class form the validation set. The remaining clips are the training set. %Query
