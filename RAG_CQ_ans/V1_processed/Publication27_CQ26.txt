Several techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include: 1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution of classes in both sets. This is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. 2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class by replicating them or creating synthetic examples. This can help balance the dataset and improve the model's performance. 3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class. This can be done randomly or by selecting the most representative examples. This can also help balance the dataset and improve the model's performance. 4. Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from a variety of sources and perspectives to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help reduce bias and improve the model's generalizability. 5. Data augmentation: This involves creating new data by applying transformations to the existing data. This can help increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's performance. 6. Transfer learning: This involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point for a new task. This can help reduce bias and improve the model's performance, especially when dealing with small datasets. 7. Fairness-aware machine learning: This involves incorporating fairness constraints into the learning process to ensure that the model does not discriminate against certain groups. This can help reduce bias and improve the model's fairness. 8. Explainable AI: This involves using techniques to make the model's decisions more transparent and understandable. This can help identify and address bias in the model. 9. Regularization: This involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalizability. This can also help reduce bias. 10. Ensemble methods: This involves combining multiple models to improve the overall performance. This can help reduce bias and improve the model's robustness.
