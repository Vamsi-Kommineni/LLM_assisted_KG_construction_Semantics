The deep learning pipeline used dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. A dropout probability of 0. 3 was applied after the second to last hidden layer. 3. Results 3. 1. Classification The trained CNN model was used to classify the moth species in the images. The model was able to classify the moth species with a high accuracy. The confusion matrix in Figure 7 shows the performance of the model on the validation set. The model had a recall of 93%, indicating that only 7% of the moth species in the validation set were missed. A similar precision of 93% was obtained, indicating that only 7% were wrongly classiÔ¨Åed. 2. Detection The detection algorithm was able to detect the insects in the images with a high accuracy.
