The deep learning pipeline uses audio data. The audio data is converted to a Mel spectrogram representation with 32 frequency bins, represented as rows in the spectrogram, using a temporal resolution of 21 columns per second of raw audio. Each column in the spectrogram is computed by running the fast Fourier transform on a section of the audio time signal. Each spectrogram column is computed from 0. 0928 s of audio (which corresponds to a window size of 2,048 samples), and has a Hann window applied. The columns are extracted from the audio signal at a frequency of 21. 53 Hz (or equivalently with a hop length of 1,024 audio samples, on our 22,050 Hz audio). Before use in the classifier, the values of the spectrogram S are converted to a log-scale representation, using the formula ln(A + B * S). For CityBioNet the parameters A = 0. 001 and B = 10. 0 are used, while for CityAnthroNet the parameters A = 0. 025 and B = 2. 0 are used. These parameters are chosen manually to emphasise biotic and anthropogenic sounds by visually inspecting the transformed spectrograms.
