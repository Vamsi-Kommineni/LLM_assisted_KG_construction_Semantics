The study used a diverse dataset, including images from different localities and countries. The number of units in the two FC layers and the dropout rate were determined by five-fold cross- validation with a random 200 images of the GH dataset. These hyperparameters were used throughout all classification tasks in this study. Within-dataset classification was performed by training the CNN model with N images randomly selected from the dataset and predicting the class of n test images randomly selected from the rest. N ranged between 100 and 700 for LH, 50 and 250 for LL, and 100 and 900 for GH. The number of test images, n, was set to 200 for LH and GH, and 50 for LL due to the small size of the dataset. To evaluate the consistency of prediction accuracy, ten replicates were generated for each scenario of N images. The output of the final softmax layer was used as the prediction probability of each class, and the image was classified to the class with the highest prediction probability. The accuracy of the prediction was measured as the proportion of successful predictions in the test set. The classification performance for each class was measured by the multiclass recall rate, multiclass precision, and the F1-score.
