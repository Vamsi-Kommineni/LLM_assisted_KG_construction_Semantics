The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is common practice to use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score to evaluate the performance of a model during training. In this context, the PTDLEN-VAE model is evaluated using these metrics on the UCM and AID datasets. The results are presented in Tables 1 and 2, and Figures 6 and 7.
