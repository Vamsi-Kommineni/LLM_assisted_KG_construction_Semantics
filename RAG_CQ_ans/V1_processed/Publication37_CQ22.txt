The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy. The methods compared in this study are evaluated using 5-fold cross validation, and the results are reported as a box-plot generated from the per-fold accuracies. For identifying the best training epoch for the CNN model, 1 of the 4 training folds is used as a validation set, and the model is trained on the remaining 3 folds. The mean accuracies are indicated by the red squares in Figure 1.
