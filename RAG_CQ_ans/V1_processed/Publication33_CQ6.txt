Before training the deep learning model, the images used to build the datasets were resized to 64 Ã— 64 pixels. Additionally, data augmentation was used to improve the model. Each "natural" image yielded 4 more images: 2 with increased contrast (120% and 140%) and 2 with decreased contrast (80% and 60%). All images were then horizontally flipped to obtain the final training dataset.
