The techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting ensures that the training and validation datasets have a similar distribution of classes. Oversampling and undersampling are used to balance the number of images for all species. Diverse data collection is used to increase the number of images for rare species.
