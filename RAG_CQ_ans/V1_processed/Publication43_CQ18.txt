The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use ﬁne-tuning by initializing the model with the pre-trained weights of ImageNet, and applying data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the dataset from 100 to 6000 images. The obtained classiﬁer converges within the ﬁrst 100 training iterations as shown in Figure 5.
