The context does not provide specific information on the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the author and their collaborators have been studying hummingbird ecology using time-lapse cameras in the Ecuadorian Andes since 2013. These cameras turn on at dawn, off at dusk, and record a photo every second for up to 5 days. Cameras filming individual flowers capture hummingbirds in less than 1% of images. This suggests that time- lapse cameras are used for data collection in this specific case.
