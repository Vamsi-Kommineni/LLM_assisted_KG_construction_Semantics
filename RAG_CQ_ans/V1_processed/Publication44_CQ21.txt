The postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the context does mention a mask postprocessing step that is applied to solve the problem of under-segmentation of individual leaves that are close together within a single mask. This involves applying simple postprocessing steps such as thresholding and masking operations to generate a new mask that is passed to phase 2. The context does not mention any other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
