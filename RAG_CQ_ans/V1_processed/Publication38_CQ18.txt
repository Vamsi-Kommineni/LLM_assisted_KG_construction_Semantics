The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the code to train and evaluate the detection algorithms is available on the GitHub page (https://github. com/macaodha/batdetect). This suggests that the model performance during training might be monitored using standard evaluation metrics, but the specific strategy is not provided in the context.
