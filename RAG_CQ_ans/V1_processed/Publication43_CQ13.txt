The helpful answer is that the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights, and the network weights can be randomly initialized if the network is trained from scratch. Additionally, transfer learning (e. g. , fine-tuning in CNNs) is used to initialize the weights of the network by the pre-trained weights on a different dataset.
