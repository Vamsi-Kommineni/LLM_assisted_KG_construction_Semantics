The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for object detection include bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image, while instance segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. In this work, bounding box annotation was used to annotate the whale presence in the images.
