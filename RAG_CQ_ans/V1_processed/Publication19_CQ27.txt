The trained deep learning model was deployed using TensorFlow Lite, which is a lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile and edge devices. The model was serialized into a. tflite file and then deployed on a Raspberry Pi Model 4B. The Raspberry Pi was chosen as the platform because it is a low-cost, low-power device that is well-suited for edge computing applications. The Raspberry Pi was able to sustain a rate of processing 1 image every 2 seconds with an average latency of 1. 8 second/image. After capture and pre-processing, each inference took an average of 0. 2 Millisecond/image on the Raspberry Pi.
