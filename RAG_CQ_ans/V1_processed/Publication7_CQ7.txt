The data was split into training and testing sets based on the year of the images. In one experiment, the classifier was trained on two-thirds of the images from the year 2011 and tested on the remaining images from the same year. In another experiment, the images from year 2011 were used for training and the images from 2012 and 2013 constitute the test set. In the third experiment, the training set consisted of two-thirds of the images from the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, whereas the test set consists of all the remaining images from the same years.
