After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are the calculation of performance metrics such as Mean Loss, Root Mean Square Error (Rmse), and Accuracy on 10% Densest Quadrats (A10%DQ). These metrics are calculated for each species and for two disjoints and randomly sampled subsets of sites: A train set (4781 sites) which is used for fitting all models and a test set (400 sites) which aims at testing models generalization capacities. Then, train and test metrics are averaged over the 50 species. The performance metrics are described in the following.
