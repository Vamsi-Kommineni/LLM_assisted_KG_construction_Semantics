The paper does not provide specific information on the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the training data was collected as part of the Indicator Bats Programme (iBats) and was uploaded to the Zooniverse citizen science platform for public users to view and annotate. The audio data was split up into 3. 84s long sound clips, and each sound clip was uploaded as both a wav file and a magnitude spectrogram image. The paper also mentions that the original recordings were time-expanded, reducing the frequency and making the sounds audible to users. However, it does not provide details on any specific data augmentation techniques applied during the deep learning pipeline.
