The experiment mentioned in Section 2. 3 involved selecting images of nine different frequently occurring insect species to train the different CNN models. The classes of species were chosen based on the recorded data from where a sufficient number of images could be selected to train the CNN models. According to the screening of the data, no other species were found in sufficient quantity to allow for their inclusion in the dataset. This indicates that the dataset was diverse and representative of the frequently occurring insect species in the recorded data. Additionally, the chosen model had an F1-score of 92. 75%, which indicated that the trained CNN was very accurate in its predictions. This final architecture was chosen because it achieved average precision, recall, and an F1-score of 93%, which indicated a suitable model classification. The confusion matrix (Figure 7) was based upon the validation of the chosen model. The confusion matrix has a diagonal trend, which indicates that the model matched the validation set well. The model had a recall of 93%, indicating that only 7% of the moth species in the validation set were missed. A similar precision of 93% was obtained, indicating that only 7% were wrongly classified. These measures suggest that the deep learning model was generalizable and accurate in its predictions.
