The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include using a constant learning rate of 0. 01, applying dropout to the input of the last two layers with probability 0. 5, and applying L2-regularization to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0. 001. Additionally, the model is trained for 100 epochs and is checkpointed after each epoch, and a validation set is used to identify the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy.
