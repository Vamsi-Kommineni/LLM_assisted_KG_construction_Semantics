The query asks about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Based on the provided context, the following measures were taken: 1. Diverse dataset: The dataset used in this work was derived from Planet's full-frame analytic scene products using its 4-band satellites in sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) and International Space Station (ISS) orbit. This dataset contains images with multiple classes, which helps in training a more generalizable model. 2. Cross-validation: The context does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation. However, it is mentioned that 20% of the training data was used for validation after training. This can be considered as a form of cross-validation, as it helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data. 3. Stratified splitting: The context does not explicitly mention the use of stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that the dataset is not balanced in nature, i. e. , all labels are not present in uniform quantity. This implies that the dataset was not split in a stratified manner, as it would have resulted in a more balanced distribution of labels. In summary, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include using a diverse dataset and performing validation on unseen data. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting.
