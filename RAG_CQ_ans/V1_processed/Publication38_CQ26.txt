The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training data was collected from citizen scientists as part of the Indicator Bats Programme (iBats) [7] and that the audio data contained many instances of low amplitude and faint bat calls, as well as other night- time ‘background’ noises such as other biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic sounds. This suggests that the data collection process aimed to capture a diverse range of sounds, which could potentially help address data bias.
