The context does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, typically, the data is split into three sets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The data is usually split randomly, but the proportion of the split can vary depending on the size of the dataset and the specific requirements of the model.
