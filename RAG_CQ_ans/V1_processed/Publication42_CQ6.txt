Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. It is a scaling technique that brings all the features to a common scale without distorting the differences in the ranges of values or losing information. Scaling is a method to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of this paper, the images were resized to 128 Ã— 128 pixels and the pixel values were scaled to a range of 0 to 1. Cleaning is another important preprocessing step, which involves removing or correcting erroneous data points. In this study, images with no insects were removed from the dataset.
