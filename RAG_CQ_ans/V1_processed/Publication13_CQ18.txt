The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the number of units in the two FC layers (512 and 256 for the first and second FC layers respectively) and the dropout rate were determined by five-fold cross-validation with a random 200 images of the GH dataset. This suggests that cross-validation was used to monitor the model performance during training.
