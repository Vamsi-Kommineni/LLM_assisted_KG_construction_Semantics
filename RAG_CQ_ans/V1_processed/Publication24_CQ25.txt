The purpose of the deep learning model is to generate measures of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) and is part of the CityNet system. The CNN is trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. The CNN is used to predict the presence or absence of biotic or anthropogenic acoustic activity in each 1-second chunk of audio. The predictions can then be aggregated to give summaries over time or space.
