The paper does not provide specific details on the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that data augmentation could be performed to make the system more robust, considering that satellite images may vary in terms of lighting effect, rotation, shifting, etc. Therefore, it can be inferred that techniques such as flipping, rotation, and scaling could potentially be applied for data augmentation in this context.
