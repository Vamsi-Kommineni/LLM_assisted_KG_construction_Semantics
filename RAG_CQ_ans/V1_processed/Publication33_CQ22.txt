The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the mean rate of correct classification of fish images in T2 by the raw CNN, which was found to be 78. 0%. The rates of correct classifications per species ranged from 54. 4% to 99. 1% (sd = 15. 16). These results serve as the baseline for further experiments. Additionally, images obtained softmax scores between 41 and 100, with 80% of images classified with a score between 60 and 100. The distribution of correct classifications and misclassifications among scores was highly variable among species.
