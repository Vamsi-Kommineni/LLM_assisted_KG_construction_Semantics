The dataset used for training the deep learning model was diverse, comprising 910 images sampled across seven phenotypically disparate reef fish families. The dataset was randomly divided into training and validation sets (ntrain = 720, nvalidation = 190; approximately 80% train, 20% validation). The model was trained for 160 epochs over three stages, with different learning rates and weight decay. Image augmentation was also used by flipping 50% of the images in the left-right orientation to increase the robustness of the neural network. Model training took approximately 8 hr to complete.
