The VGG Image Annotator (VIA) Version 2. 0. 8 (Dutta and Zisserman (2019)) is used for the annotation of the segmentation dataset. For each occurring animal in a frame of the training set, a polygonal segmentation mask depicting the visible silhouette, a bounding box and a class label, i. e. , deer, boar, fox, hare, are annotated. The polygonal silhouette of a deer shows typically around 70 vertices, while the polygonal silhouette of a hare may show only around 35 vertices.
