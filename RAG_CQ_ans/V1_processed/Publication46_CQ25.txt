The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for Species Distribution Modelling (SDM). The model is developed in such a way that the algorithm learns and adapts to the spatial hierarchies of features by itself from the lower to the higher levels of the pattern. The model is composed of three layers or building blocks: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Feature extraction is conducted using the first two layers and mapping the extracted features to the output is conducted by the third layer. The model is used to track and map the distribution of the Rhododendron arboreum species based on its occurrence and several ecological and bioclimatic satellite-based observations. The CNN based probability distribution model outperformed the presence only based BIOCLIM model with an AUC score of 0. 917.
