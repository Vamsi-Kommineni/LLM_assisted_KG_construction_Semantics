The authors used two techniques to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model: transfer learning and data augmentation. Transfer learning involves using the knowledge acquired in problem A to problem B, which was implemented by initializing the weights of the model for problem B using the pre-trained weights on problem A. Data augmentation consists of applying specific transformations to the training images, such as scaling, rotations, translations, different illumination conditions, and cropping parts of the image. These transformations simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real-world scenarios, and it was demonstrated in several works that data augmentation increases the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs.
