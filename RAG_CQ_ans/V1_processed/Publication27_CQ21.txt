The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating a confusion matrix. Saliency maps help to visualize the important features that the model used to make its predictions. Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of the model by showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
