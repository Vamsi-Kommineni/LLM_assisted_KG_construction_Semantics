The context does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset was built to assess the influence of dataset building on classification results. This was done by doubling the number of thumbnails per fish individual by flipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis, which homogenizes the proportion of left-oriented and right-oriented individuals in the database. This procedure is hypothesized to improve the average identification rate since fish individuals are seen in all positions. Additionally, the dataset was built to include thumbnails of whole fish, part of species, and environment.
