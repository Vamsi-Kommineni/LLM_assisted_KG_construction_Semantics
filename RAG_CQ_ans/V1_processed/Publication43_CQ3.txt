The paper does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the training dataset was labeled with 100 80 Ã— 80- pixels image patches containing Ziziphus lotus shrubs and 100 images for Bare soil with sparse vegetation. This suggests that the data annotation technique used was likely image patch labeling.
