The trained deep learning model was deployed by implementing it with the Detectron2 library in the PyTorch framework. The model was trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimiser with a learning rate of 0. 0025 and momentum of 0. 9. The anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network had six anchor scales [32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024] (square root of area in absolute pixels) each with three aspect ratios of [1:2, 1:1, 2:1]. The thresholds for non-maximum suppression (NMS) were 0. 6 for training and 0. 25 for testing, respectively. Due to the large image size and additional parameters of Faster R-CNN, a minibatch size of four images per GPU (TITAN Xp) was selected for training the model. The model was trained twice, once with a training subset of 498 images on a single GPU for 9000 iterations and performance evaluated on the test subset of 155 images, also on a single GPU and then trained again on all 653 annotated images on three GPUs for 18000 iterations for predicting plant organs on another un-annotated independent dataset to evaluate our method. This dataset consists of 708 full scale herbarium scans, with an average size of ca. 9600 by 6500 pixels, from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR) (Otte et al. 2011) with a different set of species (Fig. 2) and geographical origins, which is also available at GBIF (Senckenberg 2020). The Python code and the trained model have been made available at GitHub (Younis 2020).
