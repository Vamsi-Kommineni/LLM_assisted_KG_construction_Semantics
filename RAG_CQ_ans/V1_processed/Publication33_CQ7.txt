The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is mentioned that the training procedure lasted 600,000 iterations, and each iteration processed a batch of 16 images. The 691,690 images of the training dataset were analyzed 14 times each by the network on average. The training was stopped to prevent overfitting. It is also mentioned that the dataset T1 was used for the threshold-setting phase and the dataset T2 for the testing phase, and that the roles of T1 and T2 were switched to assess the robustness of the method.
