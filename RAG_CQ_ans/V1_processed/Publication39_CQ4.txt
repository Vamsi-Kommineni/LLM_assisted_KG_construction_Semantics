The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are horizontal flip, rotation, scaling, and shearing. These techniques are applied using the python library imgaug (Jung et al. (2020)) for the data augmentation of images and videos. For Mask R-CNN and FGFA, the same augmentation technique with identical parameters is applied to each frame of the video.
