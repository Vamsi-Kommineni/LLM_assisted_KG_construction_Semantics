To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, data augmentation techniques such as flipping and rotation were applied to the training images. This helped the model to generalize better as leaves were expected to be in different orientations, sizes, and locations. Additionally, the model was trained with a batch size of 32 images per iteration and applied binary cross-entropy as the loss function. The input images were resized to 300 × 300 resolution and trained for 100 epochs with an Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 1 × 10−4. The trained classifier was then used as a filter to detect whether the detected component was an individual leaf or not.
