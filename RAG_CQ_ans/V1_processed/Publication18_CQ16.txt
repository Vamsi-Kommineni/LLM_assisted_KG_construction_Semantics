The query asks about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Based on the provided context, the training process for the second CNN-based model used a learning rate of 0. 001 and a decay factor of 16 every 30 epochs. The optimization algorithm used was RMSProp with a momentum of 0. 9 and epsilon of 0. 1. However, the context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
