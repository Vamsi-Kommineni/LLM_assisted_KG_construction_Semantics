The deep learning pipeline uses a combination of unsupervised and supervised approaches for data annotation. Initially, a LIDAR-based unsupervised algorithm generates initial tree predictions, and the bounding box for each tree is extracted. This is followed by a self-supervised model trained on the RGB crops of the extracted bounding boxes. The model is then retrained using a small number of hand-annotations to correct errors from the unsupervised detection. The LIDAR data is only used to initialize the training of the network and is not used for the final prediction step. The result is a deep learning neural network that combines unsupervised and supervised approaches to perform tree delineation in new RGB imagery without the need for co-registered LIDAR data.
