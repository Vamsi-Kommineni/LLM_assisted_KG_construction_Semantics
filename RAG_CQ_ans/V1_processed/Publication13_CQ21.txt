The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as accuracy, multiclass recall rate, multiclass precision, and F1-score. Additionally, a scaled confusion matrix is generated for the prediction of Local High Quality (LH) images based on a training set of 400 or 800 randomly selected images from the same dataset (LH) or the Global High Quality (GH) dataset, respectively. The rows of the matrix represent the predicted classes, and the columns represent the true classes. The matrix is scaled so that each column sums up to one.
