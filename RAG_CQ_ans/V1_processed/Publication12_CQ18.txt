The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the ReChk strategy. This strategy involves collecting bat calls with different strengths and using them to test the model generated by BatNet. The experiment is carried out in an eight-meter-long corridor covered with plants where bats can fly freely. Two recorders are placed near the corridor, one upto six meters away from the axis of the corridor and another inside the corridor. Bats are released individually and both recorders are utilized simultaneously. Fifteen bat species are used in the experiment, including five vespertilionid species, five hipposiderid species, and five rhinolophid species. Three species are relatively hard to trap using harptraps in the main site.
