The context does not provide information on the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data is highly unbalanced and suggests using SMOTE or similar data balancing techniques to improve the results further. This implies that oversampling techniques like SMOTE could be used to address data bias in this case.
