The deep learning pipeline used in this study is not based on common datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it uses a dataset of orchid species occurrence records, which includes features such as geographic, climatic, and biome data. The dataset was obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families (WCSP). The dataset was filtered to include only species with at least 15 occurrence records available for assessment and that were assessed under the IUCN Red List categories and criteria version 3. 1. The dataset was then split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%), with 20% of the training set used for validation.
