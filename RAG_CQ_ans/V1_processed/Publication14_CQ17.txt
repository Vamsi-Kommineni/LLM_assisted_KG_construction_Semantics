The paper "Dropout: A simple way to prevent neural networks from overfitting" by Srivastava et al. (2014) discusses the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in neural networks. The paper "Deep background subtraction with scene-specific convolutional neural networks" by Braham and Van Droogenbroeck (2016) also mentions the use of L2 regularization as a regularization method.
