The purpose of the deep learning model is for family-level classification of below-ground bulk samples of Coleoptera from understudied forests of Cyprus. The model is trained with images from local surveys versus global databases of above-ground samples from tropical forests and evaluated how prediction accuracy was affected by the quality and resolution of images, the size and complexity of the training set, and the transferability of identifications across very disparate source-target pairs that do not share any species or genera. The within-dataset classification accuracy reached 98% and depended on the number and quality of training images and on dataset complexity. The accuracy of between-datasets predictions was reduced to a maximum of 82% and depended greatly on the standardisation of the imaging procedure. When the source and target images were of similar quality and resolution, albeit from different faunas, the reduction of accuracy was minimal. Application of algorithms for domain adaptation significantly improved the prediction performance of models trained by non-standardised, low-quality images. The findings demonstrate that existing databases can be used to train models and successfully classify images from unexplored biota, when the imaging conditions and classification algorithms are carefully considered. Also, the results provide guidelines for data acquisition and algorithmic development for high-throughput image-based biodiversity surveys.
