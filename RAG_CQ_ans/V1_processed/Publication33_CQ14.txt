The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through a process called back-propagation. Back- propagation consists of automatically changing parameters of the CNN through the comparison between its output and the correct class of the training element to eventually improve the final classification rate. The training procedure lasted 600,000 iterations; each iteration processed a batch of 16 images, which means that the 691,690 images of the training dataset were analyzed 14 times each by the network on average. The training was then stopped to prevent overfitting, as an overfit model is too restrictive and only able to classify images that were used during the training.
