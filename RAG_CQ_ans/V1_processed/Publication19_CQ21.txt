After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved include metrics calculation, confusion matrix, and ROC curves. The metrics calculated include accuracy, macro-F1 averages, and model size. The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the model, and ROC curves are used to visualize the performance of the model for each class. Additionally, the mean %CPU utilization and latency between capturing the image and doing the classification are also calculated.
