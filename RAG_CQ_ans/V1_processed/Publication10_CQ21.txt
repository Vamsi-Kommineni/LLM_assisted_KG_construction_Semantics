After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on common practices in deep learning, postprocessing steps could include evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, creating a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model on each class is also a common practice. Saliency maps might also be used to understand which parts of the input data are most important for the model's predictions. But without specific information, these are just possibilities and not definitive answers.
