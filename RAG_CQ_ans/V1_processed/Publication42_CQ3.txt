The dataset was created by selecting images of different individual insects from the captured sequences of images in the period of observation. The images were annotated with a bounding box for each individual, and the moth species determination was reviewed by an expert from the image only. The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. Each individual insect in the images was annotated with a bounding box, and the moth species determination was reviewed by an expert from the image only.
