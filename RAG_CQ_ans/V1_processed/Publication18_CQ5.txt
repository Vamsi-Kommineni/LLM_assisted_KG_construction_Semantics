The context does not provide specific information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that CNNs need a large number of examples to achieve good learning and that building datasets from scratch is costly and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, two techniques are used: Transfer learning and data-augmentation. Transfer-learning consists of using the knowledge acquired in problem A to problem B. This is implemented by initializing the weights of the model for problem B using the pre-trained weights on problem A. Data-augmentation consists of applying specific transformations to the training images. In general, these transformations simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real world, e. g. , scaling, rotations, translations, different illumination conditions, cropping parts of the image. It was demonstrated in several works that data-augmentation increases the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs. The context also mentions that examples of the most accurate and robust models for image classification are Inception and Inception ResNet. The most accurate detection frameworks are end-to-end object detection models that combine a sophisticated detection technique with one of the most powerful CNN classification models. At present, there exist several detection frameworks that provide good trade-off between accuracy, robustness and speed, such as, Faster-RCNN, YOLO9000, FPN, RefineDet, DSSD and Focal Dense Object Detection. Furthermore, several studies are focusing on improving these frameworks on specific remote sensing data. In this work, we used Faster-RCNN based on Inception RenNet v2, as it is the most accurate detection framework according to the this study. However, the context does not provide specific information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
