Data bias can be addressed during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline using several techniques. Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that the distribution of the target variable is preserved in both the training and testing datasets. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in imbalanced datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. Diverse data collection is another approach to address data bias, which involves collecting data from a diverse range of sources to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular group or class.
