The provided context does not mention any specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that self-supervision, which only relies on unlabeled data, can be combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework, which may improve deep learning on limited training data by providing neural networks the opportunity to learn generalized features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high quality annotations. This approach could potentially help prevent overfitting, but the context does not provide specific details on the regularization methods used.
