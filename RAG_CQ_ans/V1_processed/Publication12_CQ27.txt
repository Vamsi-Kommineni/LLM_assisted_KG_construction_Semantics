The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the models were trained in the GPU for the four networks (BatNet, CNNFULL, VggNet, and ResNet_v2). It is also mentioned that the package sklearn was used to calculate and plot the performance metrics of the models. Therefore, it can be inferred that the trained deep learning models were deployed using the GPU and the sklearn package in Python. However, the specific process of model serialization or platform selection is not mentioned.
