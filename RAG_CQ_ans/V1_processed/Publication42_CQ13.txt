The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include kernel size for the first and last layer, convolutional depth for the first and last layer, fully connected size, and the optimizer. The kernel size for the first layer was 5 × 5, and for the last layer, it was 3 × 3. The convolutional depth for the first layer was 32, and for the last layer, it was 64. The fully connected size was 512. The optimizer used was either Adam or SGD.
