The performance evaluation of the model is conducted by tuning the learnable parameters, kernels, and weight by a loss function through the forward propagation followed by updating these parameter values through an optimization algorithm either by backpropagation or gradient descent. However, the context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as using grid search or random search.
