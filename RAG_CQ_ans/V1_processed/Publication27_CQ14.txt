The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search. The grid search is performed using the validation set, and the hyperparameters that result in the best performance on the validation set are selected. The hyperparameters that are optimized include the learning rate, the number of hidden units, the number of layers, and the dropout rate. The grid search is performed using a range of values for each hyperparameter, and the combination of hyperparameters that results in the best performance on the validation set is selected.
