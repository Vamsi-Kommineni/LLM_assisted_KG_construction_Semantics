The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is created by selecting images of different individual insects from the captured sequences of images in the period of observation. The dataset contains many wasps (Vespula vulgaris) and a separate class containing a variation of cropped background images. A total of ten classes was used for training with nine different insects including seven different moth species and one subtribe. These images were annotated with a bounding box for each individual, and the moth species determination was reviewed by an expert from the image only. The dataset was scaled with a factor of 32 times, resulting in 72,000 images, where each class contained 8000 data points after augmentation. From this dataset, 80% was used for training and 20% for validation of the CNN model.
