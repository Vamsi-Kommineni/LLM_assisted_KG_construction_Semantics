The evaluation metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR). AP is a numeric metric to compare precision-recall curves from different detectors, while AR is averaged over different IoU thresholds. The AP for COCO datasets is calculated as the average precision for different recall levels of the same detector, while the AR is calculated as the average recall for different IoU thresholds. The AR is also averaged over all classes and is denoted as AR. The ARmax=1 and ARmax=10 are considered, which are calculated for 1 detection and a maximum of 10 detections in one image, respectively. Both ARs are averaged over the described 10 IoU thresholds.
