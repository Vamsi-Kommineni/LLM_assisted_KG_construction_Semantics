The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a validation dataset. The validation dataset is used to evaluate the model performance after each epoch during training. This allows for the detection of overfitting and the adjustment of the learning rate and other hyperparameters as needed. The answer is based on the following pieces of context: * The model performance is monitored during training using a validation dataset. * The validation dataset is used to evaluate the model performance after each epoch during training. * This allows for the detection of overfitting and the adjustment of the learning rate and other hyperparameters as needed.
