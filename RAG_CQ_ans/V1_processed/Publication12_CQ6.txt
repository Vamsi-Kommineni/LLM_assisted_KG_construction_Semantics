The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model uses batch normalization to standardize the parameters with batch images, which greatly alleviates the impact of high image variability including distortions or overlaps. This suggests that preprocessing steps such as normalization and cleaning may be involved, but the specifics are not mentioned.
