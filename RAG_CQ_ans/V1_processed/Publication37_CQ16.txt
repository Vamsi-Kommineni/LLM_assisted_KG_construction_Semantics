The model is trained for 100 epochs and is checkpointed after each epoch. A validation set is used to identify the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy. The best training epoch for the CNN model is identified using 1 of the 4 training folds as a validation set, and training on the remaining 3 folds.
