The context does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some commonly used techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets, or strata, based on certain characteristics and then splitting the data into training and testing sets such that the distribution of the strata is preserved in both sets. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of instances in the majority class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources and perspectives to ensure that the data is representative of the population being studied.
