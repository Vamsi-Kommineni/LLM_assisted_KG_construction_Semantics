The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed value, include setting a fixed seed value for reproducibility, using techniques like cross- validation to reduce the impact of randomness, and employing ensemble methods to combine the results of multiple models trained with different random seeds.
