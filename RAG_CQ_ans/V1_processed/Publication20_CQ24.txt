The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include using a fixed random seed value for reproducibility, using techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting, and using ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random seeds. Additionally, using a large and diverse dataset can help to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.
