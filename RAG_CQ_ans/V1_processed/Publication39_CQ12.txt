The pipeline uses a SlowFast architecture, which is a type of deep learning model that uses two pathways for video input, a Slow pathway and a Fast pathway. The Slow pathway works on a low frame rate and low temporal resolution for detecting spatial semantics, while the Fast pathway uses a high frame rate to capture motion and the temporal aspects in the video. The backbone for the pathways can be implemented by different networks, with ResNets achieving the best results. SlowFast is a single-stream architecture that works on two different frame rates.
