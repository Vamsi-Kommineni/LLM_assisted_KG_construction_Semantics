Evaluation of the CNN Model To evaluate the performance of the trained CNN model, a separate test dataset was created. The test dataset was created by selecting images of different individual insects from the captured sequences of images in the period of observation. The test dataset was created in the same way as the training dataset, but with different individuals. The test dataset contained 100 images of each species, resulting in a total of 900 images. The test dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the trained CNN model. The performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. The precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. The recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total actual positive observations. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The results of the evaluation are shown in Table 3. The results show that the trained CNN model has a high performance for all classes. The model has a high precision, recall, and F1-score for all classes. The model has a high performance for all classes, with an average precision, recall, and F1-score of 93%. Table 3.
