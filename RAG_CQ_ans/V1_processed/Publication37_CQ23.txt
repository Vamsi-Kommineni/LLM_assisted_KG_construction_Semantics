The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured by using a diverse dataset, the CLO-43SD dataset, which includes 5428 audio clips of flight calls from 43 different species of North American wood-warblers. The dataset is comprised of recordings from various recording conditions, including clean recordings, noisier field recordings, and recordings from birds in captivity. The model was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, where the dataset was divided into 5 folds and the model was trained and tested on different folds. The best training epoch for the CNN model was identified using 1 of the 4 training folds as a validation set, and training on the remaining 3 folds.
