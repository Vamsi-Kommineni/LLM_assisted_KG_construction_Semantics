The provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps before training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the acquired audio files are segmented into 15-second windows and passed to a feature extractor function where MFCC is used to return the extracted features for the classifier. This can be considered as a form of preprocessing.
