The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are increasing and decreasing contrast. Each "natural" image yielded 4 more images: 2 with increased contrast (120% and 140%) and 2 with decreased contrast (80% and 60%). Additionally, all images were horizontally flipped to obtain the final training dataset.
