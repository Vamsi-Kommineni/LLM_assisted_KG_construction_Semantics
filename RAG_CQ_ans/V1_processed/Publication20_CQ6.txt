The context does not provide explicit information about preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model. However, it mentions that the raw training dataset of 20 fish species was used to build 4 different datasets to assess the influence of the dataset building on classification results. This involved doubling the number of thumbnails per fish individual by flipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis. This procedure homogenizes the proportion of left- oriented and right-oriented individuals in the database. Additionally, the context mentions that the training lasted 8 days on a computer with 64GB of RAM, an i7 3. 50GHz CPU, and a Titan X GPU card for 900,000 images. However, it does not provide specific details about preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
