The study used a diverse dataset that included unfiltered audio-files recorded in different environments, such as nature habitats and human living areas. The dataset contained signal regions full of echos, background noises, and high intra-species acoustic variation. To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the study introduced dataset-with-weak and ReChk strategy, which greatly reduced the false positive and misidentification rate. Additionally, BNorm layers were added to standardize the parameters with batch images, which alleviated the impact of high image variability and allowed the model to identify data from wider regions.
