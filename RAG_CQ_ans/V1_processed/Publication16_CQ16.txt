The results presented in this section were obtained over 100 epochs. Figure 9 shows the loss of the model using both the test and validation data during model training. The figure shows that there was no overfitting during training and that the dropout layers helped with model regularisation. Although model convergence was achieved early in the training session the loss shows continuing decreases throughout the specified epochs. The model achieved an accuracy of 0. 83 for the train split and 0. 74 for the test split. Figure 10 shows the accuracy for both the train and validation data over 100 epochs. The results illustrate that the accuracy of the model flattens towards the end of the training session and shows that the necessary number of epochs required for model convergence is sufficient. Increasing the number of epochs would achieve minimal gains in accuracy and would likely lead to overfitting.
