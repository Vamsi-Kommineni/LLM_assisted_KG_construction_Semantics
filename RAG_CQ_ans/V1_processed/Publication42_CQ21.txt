After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved include the validation of the best model using a confusion matrix, as shown in Figure 7. The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, the F1-score is calculated to measure the model's accuracy. The model is also compared with selected state-of-the-art CNN optimized architectures such as EfﬁcientNetB0, DenseNet121, ResNetV50, and InceptionNetV3. The detection of insects is summarized based on the number of counted insects, the number of moth species found, and the number of unknown insects found. The statistics are updated as the images are analyzed to enable visual inspection of the result during processing. The classiﬁcation phase simultaneously classiﬁes each individual and assigns labels to each individual species. An insect is only counted if it is observed in more than three consecutive images to ignore noise created by insects ﬂying close to the camera. Several other parameters are deﬁned and adjusted to ﬁlter similar noisy tracks created by very small insects.
