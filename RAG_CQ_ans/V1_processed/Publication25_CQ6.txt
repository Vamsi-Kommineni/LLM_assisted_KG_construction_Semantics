The context does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a specific range, such as between 0 and 1. Scaling involves adjusting the input data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Cleaning involves removing any irrelevant or incorrect data from the input dataset.
