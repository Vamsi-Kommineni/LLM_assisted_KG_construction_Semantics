The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using precision and recall metrics. The results show that the deep learning networks consistently outperformed other baselines in terms of recall, i. e. , increasing the proportion of detected bat calls in the test datasets. Although the precision of the commercial systems was often relatively high, the CNNs were able to detect much fainter and partially noise-masked bat calls that were missed by the other methods, with fewer false positives, and very quickly, particularly with CNNFAST.
