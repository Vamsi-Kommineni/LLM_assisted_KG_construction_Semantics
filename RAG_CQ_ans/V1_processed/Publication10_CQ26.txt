The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data augmentation techniques applied to bird vocalizations, such as small random rotations between -5 and 5 degrees and random displacements at the maximum of the 10% of the image. These techniques are used to accommodate within-species vocal variations and to make a global bird detector. The context does not discuss stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
