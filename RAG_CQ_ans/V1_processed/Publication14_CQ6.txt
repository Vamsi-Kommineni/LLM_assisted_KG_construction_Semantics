The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization scales the data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, to ensure that all features have the same scale. Scaling adjusts the range of the data, often to a standard range such as -1 to 1 or 0 to 1. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data. These steps are important to ensure that the model can accurately learn from the data and make accurate predictions.
