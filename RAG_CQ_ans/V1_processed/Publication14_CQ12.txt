The pipeline uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, specifically Google's Inception V3 model, which was originally trained on the 2012 ImageNet data. The model is fine-tuned for the specific task by freezing the lower layers of the architecture and retraining the top layers to better fit the new dataset.
