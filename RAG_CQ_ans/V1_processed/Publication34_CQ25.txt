The purpose of the deep learning model is to learn a function that takes the environmental feature vector of a given location as input and outputs an estimate of the abundance of the species. The main underlying hypothesis is that the abundance function is related to the fundamental ecological niche of the species, in the sense of Hutchinson. That means that in theory, a given species is likely to live in a single privileged ecological niche, characterized by an unimodal distribution in the environmental space. However, in reality, the abundance function is expected to be more complex. Many phenomena can actually affect the distribution of the species relative to its so called abiotic preferences. For instance, environment perturbations, or geographical constraints, or interactions with other living organisms (including humans) might have encourage specimens of that species to live in a different environment. As a consequence, the realized ecological niche of a species can be much more diverse and complex than its hypothetical fundamental niche.
