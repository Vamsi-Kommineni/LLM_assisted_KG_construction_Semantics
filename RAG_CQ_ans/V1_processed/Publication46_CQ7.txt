The context does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The split is often done randomly, but it can also be done in a stratified manner to ensure that each set has a similar distribution of classes. %Query
