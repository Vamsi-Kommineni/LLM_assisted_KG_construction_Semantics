The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used for model evaluation in Challenges 1, 3, and 4. This technique involves using a single observation from the original sample as the validation set and the remaining observations as the training set. This is repeated such that each observation in the sample is used once as the validation set. Additionally, it is mentioned that the validation parameter was increased to 20% due to the limited number of images per species.
