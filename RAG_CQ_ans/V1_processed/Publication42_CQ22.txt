The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the F1-score, which is a measure of the model's accuracy. The F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The model achieved an F1-score of 92. 75%, indicating that it was very accurate in its predictions. The model also had a recall of 93%, indicating that only 7% of the moth species in the validation set were missed, and a precision of 93%, indicating that only 7% were wrongly classified.
