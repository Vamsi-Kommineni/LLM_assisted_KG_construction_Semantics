The criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is common in machine learning to use validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete. This means that training is considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing and starts to plateau, indicating that the model is no longer improving its performance on the validation data.
