To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, a diverse dataset was used for training, which included images of 20 different fish species. Secondly, data augmentation was applied to the native biodiversity and ecosystem images to improve the model. This involved creating four additional images for each "natural" image with increased and decreased contrast, as well as horizontally flipping all images. Lastly, two independent datasets (T1 and T2) were used for tuning the thresholds and testing the model, respectively. These datasets were made of different videos recorded on different days and on different sites than the videos used to build the training dataset. This method ensured that the results were not biased by similar acquisition conditions between the training, tuning, and testing datasets, and hence that the algorithm performance was evaluated using a realistic full cross-validation procedure.
