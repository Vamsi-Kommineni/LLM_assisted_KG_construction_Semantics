 The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using precision and recall metrics. The
fraction of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives were also computed,
using the same threshold. These analyses were conducted in python v.2.7.12 using scikit-learn
v.0.18.1 and matplotlib v.1.5.1. The experiments were run on a machine running Ubuntu 16.04 with a
3.60 GHz Xeon processor, 64 GB of RAM, and a 2 GB Nvidia GPU.
