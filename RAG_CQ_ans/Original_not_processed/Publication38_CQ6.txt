 The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a
deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps in deep learning include normalization,
scaling, and cleaning of the data. Normalization is the process of rescaling the data to a standard
range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling is the process of adjusting the range of the data, which can
be useful when the data has a large range. Cleaning the data involves removing any irrelevant or
incorrect data points, as well as handling missing data. These preprocessing steps can help improve
the performance and efficiency of the deep learning model.
