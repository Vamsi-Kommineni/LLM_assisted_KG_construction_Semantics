 The performance of the deep learning models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, macro-F1
averages, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). The best performing model was Inception-V3 with a
macro Average F1 score of 0.93 and the smallest size of 175 MB. The ROC curves for the Inception-V3
model showed that it performed well for all classes, with the lowest AUC being for the "other" class
(AUC=0.98). The confusion matrix for the Inception-V3 model showed that most large errors occurred
due to the model not being able to classify the ghost images accurately. The classes with labels
(e.g., Fox, Donkey, Goat, and Sheep) were classified quite accurately.
