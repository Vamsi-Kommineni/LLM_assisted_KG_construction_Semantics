 The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided
context. However, it is mentioned that the number of units in the two FC layers (512 and 256 for the
first and second FC layers respectively) and the dropout rate were determined by five-fold cross-
validation with a random 200 images of the GH dataset. These hyperparameters were used throughout
all classification tasks in this study.
