 Data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include scaling, rotations,
translations, different illumination conditions, and cropping parts of the image. These
transformations simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real world. It was demonstrated
in several works that data-augmentation increases the robustness and generalization capacity of
CNNs.
