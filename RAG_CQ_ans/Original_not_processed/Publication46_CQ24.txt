 The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed
value, include setting a fixed seed value for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-
validation, and employing ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness on the final results.
%Context Context:  Deep learning models are often trained using stochastic optimization algorithms,
which introduce randomness into the training process. This randomness can affect the performance of
the model and make it difficult to reproduce results. To handle this, several strategies are
employed:  1. Setting a fixed seed value: By setting a fixed seed value for the random number
generator, the same sequence of random numbers will be generated each time the code is run. This can
help ensure reproducibility of results. 2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to
evaluate the performance of a model by training it on different subsets of the data and testing it
on the remaining data. This can help reduce the impact of randomness on the final results. 3.
Ensemble methods: Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to make a final
prediction. By using an ensemble of models, the impact of randomness on the final results can be
reduced.  %Answer Answer: The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning
pipeline, such as the random seed value, include setting a fixed seed value for reproducibility,
using techniques like cross-validation, and employing ensemble methods to reduce the impact of
randomness on the final results.
