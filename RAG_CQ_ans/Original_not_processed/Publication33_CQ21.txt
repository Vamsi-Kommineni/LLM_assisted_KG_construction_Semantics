 The postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned in the
provided context. However, based on the context, we can infer that the postprocessing steps might
involve setting a confidence threshold for each class to obtain three types of results: correct,
misclassified, and unsure. The goal is then to transform as many misclassifications as possible into
"Unsure" while preventing the transformation of too many correct classifications into "Unsure". The
optimal thresholds are selected based on the dataset and user-specific objectives, such as
minimizing misclassification error rate, maximizing correct classification rate, or minimizing
unsure classifications. The postprocessing steps might also involve the calculation of metrics such
as correct classification rate, misclassification error rate, and unsure classification rate.
However, the context does not provide explicit information on the use of saliency maps or confusion
matrix.
