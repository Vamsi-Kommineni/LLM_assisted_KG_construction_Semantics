 The postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned in the
provided context. However, based on common practices in machine learning, these steps could include
calculating performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, conditional kappa,
true skill statistic), creating a confusion matrix, and generating saliency maps to visualize the
model's decision-making process.
