 The performance evaluation of the model is conducted by tuning the learnable parameters, kernels,
and weight by a loss function through the forward propagation followed by updating these parameter
values through an optimization algorithm either by backpropagation or gradient descent.  The answer
does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, but
it does mention that the parameter values are updated through an optimization algorithm, either by
backpropagation or gradient descent. However, it does not specify which optimization techniques,
such as SGD or Adam, are used. Therefore, the answer is not fully helpful in this context.  Final
Answer: The optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly
mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the parameter values are updated
through an optimization algorithm, either by backpropagation or gradient descent.
