 The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided
context. However, it is mentioned that Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121 were
trained on data consisting of 33,984 images taken during day and night with 6 animal classes. It is
also mentioned that all architectures were pre-initialized to ImageNet weights. Therefore, it can be
inferred that the dataset used for training the models is a custom dataset consisting of 33,984
images of 6 animal classes, and that ImageNet was used for pre-initialization of the models.
