 The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using three metrics: precision (also called
positive predictive value, i.e., how many detected Ziziphus are true), recall (also known as
sensitivity, i.e., how many actual Ziziphus were detected), and F1 measure, which evaluates the
balance between precision and recall.
