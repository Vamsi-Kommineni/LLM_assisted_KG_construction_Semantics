 The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy,
multiclass recall rate, multiclass precision, and the F1-score. The accuracy is measured as the
proportion of successful predictions in the test set. The multiclass recall rate is defined as a
proportion of correct predictions of a class out of the actual number of images of that class. The
multiclass precision is defined as a proportion of correct predictions of a class out of the number
of images predicted as that class. The F1-score is a harmonic mean of the multiclass recall rate and
precision.
