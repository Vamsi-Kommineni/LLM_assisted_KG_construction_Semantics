 The paper does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning
pipeline. However, it is mentioned that each training image has 50 pixels marked with corresponding
ground truth labels. This suggests that the annotation technique used is pixel-level annotation or
semantic segmentation.
