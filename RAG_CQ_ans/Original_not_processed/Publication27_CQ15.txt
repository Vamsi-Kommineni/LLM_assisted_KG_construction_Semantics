 The deep learning pipeline uses various optimization techniques, including Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). SGD is a simple yet effective optimization
algorithm that updates the model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function. Adam, on the
other hand, is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that computes individual learning
rates for different parameters. Other optimization techniques used in deep learning include RMSprop,
AdaGrad, and AdaDelta.  Final Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses various optimization
techniques, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), RMSprop,
AdaGrad, and AdaDelta.
