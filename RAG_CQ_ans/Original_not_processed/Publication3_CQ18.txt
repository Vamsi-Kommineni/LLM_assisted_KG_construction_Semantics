 The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to calibrate models
for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps and considering two factors:
correct identification rate and processing time. For all challenges except Challenge 3, 4000
training steps were chosen as the optimum number. For Challenge 3, 8000 training steps proved to be
the optimum number.
