 The raw data is collected using acoustic sensors, specifically a Samsung S10, which records garden
birds and automatically uploads the acquired audio to the platform using the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP) for classification. The acquired audio files are transmitted over 4G using SMTP. The
audio file is segmented into 15 second windows. Each of the sample windows are passed to the feature
extractor function where MFCC is used to return the extracted features for the classifier. The
predicted vector is processed and logged to the site for review.
