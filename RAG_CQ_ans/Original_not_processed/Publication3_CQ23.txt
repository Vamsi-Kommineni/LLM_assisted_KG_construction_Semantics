 To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. These
include using a diverse dataset, employing a leave-one-out cross-validation technique, and
increasing the validation parameter to 20%. The leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used to
evaluate model performance in Challenges 1, 3, and 4. Additionally, the validation parameter was
increased to 20% due to the limited number of images per species (n = 20).
