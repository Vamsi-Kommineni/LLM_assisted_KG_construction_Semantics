 The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include using a fixed
random seed value, using a deterministic algorithm, or using a combination of both. A fixed random
seed value ensures that the same results are obtained each time the model is run, while a
deterministic algorithm ensures that the same results are obtained regardless of the input data. A
combination of both can be used to ensure that the model is both reproducible and robust.  %Context
1. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks with
representation learning. 2. Randomness is an inherent part of deep learning, as it is used to
initialize the weights of the neural network and to select the training data. 3. To handle
randomness in the deep learning pipeline, a fixed random seed value can be used to ensure that the
same results are obtained each time the model is run. 4. Alternatively, a deterministic algorithm
can be used to ensure that the same results are obtained regardless of the input data. 5. A
combination of both can also be used to ensure that the model is both reproducible and robust.
%Explanation The context provides information about the use of randomness in deep learning and the
strategies employed to handle it. The query asks about the strategies employed to handle randomness
in the deep learning pipeline. The helpful answer is that the strategies employed to handle
randomness in the deep learning pipeline include using a fixed random seed value, using a
deterministic algorithm, or using a combination of both. This answer is helpful because it provides
a clear and concise explanation of the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning
pipeline.
