 The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the mean identification success rate,
correct identification rate, confusion between fish species, and success rate. The mean
identification success rate is close to 87%, and the success rate ranges from 85.2 to 100% with only
3 species being correctly identified in < 90% of cases and 9 species being correctly identified in >
95% of cases, including 3 with a correct identification rate > 99%. Confusions between 2 fish
species were lower than 4%, and applying decision rule r1 decreased this error rate to < 4%. The
best model had a lower performance than humans but both were higher than 97%. The mean time needed
to identify a fish by humans was 5 s, with the fastest answer given in 2 s and the longest in 9 s.
On average, each classification by the final model took 0.06 s with hardware detailed above.
