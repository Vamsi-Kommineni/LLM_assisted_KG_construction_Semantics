 The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided
context. However, it is mentioned that the validation dataset included 19,614 images. The context
also mentions that the images were manually assigned into four categories and that the size-reduced
images were packaged into two datasets: training dataset with 85% of images (111,244/130,858) and
validation dataset with 15% (19,614/130,858). It is also mentioned that the images were converted to
64*64 pixels to save training time and reduce high memory graphics use.
