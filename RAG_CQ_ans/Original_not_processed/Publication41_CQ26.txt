 The techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include
stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting
ensures that the distribution of classes in the training and validation sets is the same as in the
original dataset. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the number of
samples in each class. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while
undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. Diverse data collection involves
collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the
population.
