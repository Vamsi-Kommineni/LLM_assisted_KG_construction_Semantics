 Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These
can include:  1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or
missing values in the dataset.  2. Data normalization or standardization: This involves scaling the
data to a common range or distribution, such as between 0 and 1 or with a mean of 0 and standard
deviation of 1. This can help improve the performance and convergence of the model.  3. Data
transformation: This involves converting the data into a format that is more suitable for the model,
such as one-hot encoding categorical variables or converting text data into numerical vectors.  4.
Data splitting: This involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The
training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and
prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.  5.
Data augmentation: This involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations
to the existing data, such as rotations, translations, or flips. This can help improve the
generalization and robustness of the model.  6. Feature selection or engineering: This involves
selecting or creating the most relevant and informative features for the model, such as extracting
features from images or text or combining multiple features into a single feature.  These
preprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific dataset and task, and may require domain-
specific knowledge or expertise.
