be made to the deep learning model?"  Helpful Answer: A few additions may be made to this work for
improvements mentioned below:  Using a larger neural network is likely to give a better result.
Models like ResNet and Inception, which are deeper in nature may give better results than the VGG16
model.  Also, the dataset may help in better classiﬁcation. In this work, it has been shown how
resizing the provided image to 128x128 pixels can be made to obtain good performance. No
preprocessing involving the texture and nature of the image itself was performed.  Performing data
augmentation to make the system more robust may be another way of getting better results. Since the
satellite images may vary in terms of lighting effect, rotation, shifting, etc., it may be a good
idea to perform data augmentation to enlarge the dataset for better training.  These things may be
investigated in the upcoming future to improve the accuracy and robustness of this model.
