 The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by using a constant learning rate of 0.01 and
applying dropout to the input of the last two layers with probability 0.5. L2-regularization is
applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0.001. The model is trained
for 100 epochs and is checkpointed after each epoch. A validation set is used to identify the
parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy.
