 The provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning
model, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the hyperparameters
involved in convolution operations are the size and number of kernels. The size could be anything
from 3 × 3 to 5 × 5 to 7 × 7, and the kernel could be chosen randomly.
