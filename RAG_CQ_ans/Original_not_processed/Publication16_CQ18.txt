 The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use both the test
and validation data. The loss of the model using both the test and validation data during model
training is presented in Figure 9. The figure shows that there was no overfitting during training
and that the dropout layers helped with model regularisation. Although model convergence was
achieved early in the training session, the loss shows continuing decreases throughout the specified
epochs.
