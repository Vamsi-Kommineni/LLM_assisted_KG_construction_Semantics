 The performance of the deep learning model, IUC-NN, is evaluated using accuracy and cross-entropy
loss. The accuracy is measured for both binary (possibly threatened vs. not threatened) and detailed
(CR, EN, VU, NT, and LC) conservation status predictions. Cross-entropy loss is used to quantify the
average validation loss during cross-validation.
