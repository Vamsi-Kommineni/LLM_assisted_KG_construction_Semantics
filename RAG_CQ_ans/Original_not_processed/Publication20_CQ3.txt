 The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in
the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the training dataset was built by doubling the
number of thumbnails per fish individual by flipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical
axis. This procedure homogenizes the proportion of left-oriented and right-oriented individuals in
the database. It is also mentioned that the test dataset was built using 6 videos recorded in
contexts different from those of videos used for training, and that annotations of these videos were
made like the training dataset except that it included fish individuals partially hidden by other
fish or by corals as well as fish individuals viewed from front or back. Therefore, it can be
inferred that the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include image
flipping and annotation of fish individuals in various orientations and occlusion levels. However,
the specific techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation are not explicitly
mentioned.
