 The study utilizes a combination of surveyed and estimated richness information collected in South
Korea and multitemporal remote sensing data. The surveyed data is likely collected through field
surveys, while the remote sensing data is collected using satellite sensors. The specific sensors
used are not mentioned, but the study does mention using MODIS products, which are collected using
the MODIS sensor on board the Terra and Aqua satellites.
