 The training of the detection framework is done in terms of the mean Dice coefficient loss
function. The Dice coefficient is used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted
segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. The formula is given by:  YXYX*2  Where, X is the
predicted set of pixels and Y is the ground truth. The Dice coefficient is the quotient of
similarity and ranges between 0 and 1. It can be viewed as a similarity measure over sets. The loss
function is just the minus of the Dice coefficient with the additions of a smoothing factor inserted
in the denominator. The score in Table I is the mean of the Dice coefficients of images in the
evaluation set.  The training is complete when the desired level of performance is achieved, which
is determined by the mean Dice coefficient loss function. The training is stopped when the loss
function reaches a plateau or when the desired level of performance is achieved.
