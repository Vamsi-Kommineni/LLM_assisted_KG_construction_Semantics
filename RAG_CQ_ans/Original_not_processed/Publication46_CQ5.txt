 The context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning
pipeline.  %Explanation The context only discusses the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
for species distribution modeling (SDM) and its comparison with other SDMs like BIOCLIM. It does not
mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
