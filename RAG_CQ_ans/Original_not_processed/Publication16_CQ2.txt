 The deep learning pipeline uses audio data. The acquired audio files are transmitted over 4G using
SMTP. The audio file is segmented into 15 second windows. Each of the sample windows are passed to
the feature extractor function where MFCC is used to return the extracted features for the
classifier. The predicted vector is processed and logged to the site for review.
