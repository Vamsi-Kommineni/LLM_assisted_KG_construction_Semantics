 The deep learning pipeline used four different datasets to assess the influence of the dataset
building on classification results. These datasets are T1, T2, T3, and T4. T1 contained raw fish
thumbnails and their respective mirror images. T2 contained whole fish and part of fish thumbnails.
T3 contained whole fish, environment, and part of fish thumbnails. T4 contained whole fish,
environment, and part of species thumbnails. The first training dataset T1 contained raw fish
thumbnails (T0) and their respective mirror images. More precisely, they doubled the number of
thumbnails per fish individual by flipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis. This
annotation procedure yielded a training dataset (T0) with 44,625 annotated fish thumbnails belonging
to 20 species. The 20 species present in the training dataset represent the most common species
appearing in the videos and belong to 12 families among the most diverse and abundant on coral reefs
worldwide.
