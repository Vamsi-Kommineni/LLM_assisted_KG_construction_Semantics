 The training process is completed after 30 epochs for both networks. The evaluation results for
frame sequences showing animals with less articulated characteristics are depicted in the right
columns of Table 4. Both networks show similar results. Especially FGFA achieves much higher
precision and recall values than for the basic evaluation set. Also the values for Mask R-CNN
increase on this test set. FGFA is still slightly worse than Mask R-CNN. The training process is not
based on a validation loss plateau.
