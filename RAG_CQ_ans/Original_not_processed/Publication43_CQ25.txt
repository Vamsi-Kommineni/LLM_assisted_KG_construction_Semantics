 The purpose of the deep learning model is for supervised classification. It is used to
automatically discover increasingly higher level features from data. The lower convolutional layers
capture low-level image features, e.g. edges, color, while higher convolutional layers capture more
complex features, i.e., composite of several features. The deep learning model used in this work is
GoogLeNet, which was the winner of ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition
(ILSVRC)) 2014. It provides higher accuracy with less computational cost compared to previous
network architectures.
