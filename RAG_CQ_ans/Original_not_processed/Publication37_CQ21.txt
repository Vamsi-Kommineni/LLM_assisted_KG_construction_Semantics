 After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are not explicitly mentioned in the
provided context. However, based on common practices in machine learning, the postprocessing steps
could include evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix could be generated to visualize the performance of
the model. Saliency maps might also be used to understand which parts of the input data are most
important for the model's predictions.
