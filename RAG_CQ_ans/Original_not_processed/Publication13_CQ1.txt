 The context does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in
the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that specimens from bulk-samples were air-dried and
placed at regular distances onto filter paper in a Petri dish. Bulk-sample photographs were taken
using a Zeiss AXIO Zoom.V16 Stereo Zoom Microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam HRc (High
Resolution 13 Megapixels Color Microscope) camera at the Imaging and Analysis Centre at the Natural
History Museum (NHM) in London, United Kingdom. This suggests that the raw data for this study was
collected using a microscope and camera.
