 The context does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep
learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning the
data. Normalization is the process of rescaling the data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1.
Scaling is the process of adjusting the range of the data to a specific scale, often between -1 and
1. Cleaning the data involves removing any missing or irrelevant data points.  %Query Query: "What
is the difference between a convolutional layer and a pooling layer in a CNN?"  Helpful Answer: A
convolutional layer is used for feature extraction in a CNN. It applies a kernel to an input tensor
to obtain a feature map. The process is repeated on multiple kernels to obtain random feature maps
that represent different feature extractors. A pooling layer offers downsampling functionality that
decreases the dimensionality of the feature maps to achieve translation invariance to the
alterations and the biases incorporated. It helps in reducing the number of learnable parameters.
There are two types of pooling operations, namely Max Pooling and Global Average Pooling. Max
Pooling extracts speckles from the input feature maps and offers maximum values in each of the
speckles and leaves the remaining values unattended. Global Average Pooling downsamples a feature
map with a size equaling product of height and width into an array of a one cross one by averaging
the elements of each feature map by retaining the depth of the feature map.  %Query Query: "What is
the purpose of the fully connected layer in a CNN?"  Helpful Answer: The features extracted by the
convolution layers followed by downsampling by the pooling layers are mapped using a subset of fully
connected layers to the final output of the network. The fully connected layer is executed with the
ReLU function. It maps the features extracted by the convolution and pooling layers to the final
output of the network.  %Query Query: "What is the difference between TPR and FPR?"  Helpful Answer:
TPR (True Positive Rate) is also known as sensitivity, probability of detection, or recall. It
provides the percentage of correctly predicted instances of species other than rhododendron. FPR
(False Positive Rate) is also known as the probability of false alarm. It is calculated as 1 -
specificity. Specificity is the percentage of correctly predicted instances of rhododendron
distribution.  %Query Query: "What is the purpose of the SoftMax function in a CNN?"  Helpful
