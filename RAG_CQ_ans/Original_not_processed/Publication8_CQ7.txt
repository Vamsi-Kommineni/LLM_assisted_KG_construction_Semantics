 The data was split into a training subset of 498 images and a test subset of 155 images. The model
was trained on the training subset and evaluated on the test subset. The model was then trained
again on all 653 annotated images for predicting plant organs on another un-annotated independent
dataset to evaluate the method. This dataset consists of 708 full scale herbarium scans from the
Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR) with a different set of species and geographical origins.
