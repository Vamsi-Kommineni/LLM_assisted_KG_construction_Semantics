 The context does not provide specific information on the data annotation techniques used in the
deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the training data in [18] are extracted manually,
and this manual tagging process would also be possible in audio spectrograms. In this work, a
modified version of [6] is used to extract automatically the mask of the spectrogram of a bird
recording. The training set is composed of spectrogram figures of bird recordings as well as
recordings void of any bird activity and their corresponding binary masks.
