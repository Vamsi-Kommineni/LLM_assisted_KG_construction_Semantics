 The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided
context. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact location of the code repository. However, it is
mentioned that the pipeline uses a LIDAR-based unsupervised detection to generate initial training
data for a self-supervised RGB deep learning model, which is then retrained based on a small number
of hand-annotated trees to create the full model.
