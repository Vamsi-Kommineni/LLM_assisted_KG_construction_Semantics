 The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before
training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps in machine learning include
normalization, scaling, and cleaning of data. Normalization is the process of rescaling the data to
a common range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling is the process of adjusting the values of a dataset
to a specific range or unit. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting errors,
inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in the data. These steps are important to ensure that the data is
in a suitable format for training a deep learning model.
