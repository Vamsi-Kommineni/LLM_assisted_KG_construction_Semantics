 The experiments were conducted using the R framework (version 3.3.2). The deep learning models were
built using the mxnet library, which is a C++ library for learning deep neural network models and is
deployed as an R package. It integrates a high-level symbolic language for quickly building
customized models and loss functions, and automatically distributes calculations under CPUs or GPUs.
