 The dataset used in this work has been derived from Planets full-frame analytic scene products
using its 4-band satellites in sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) and International Space Station (ISS)
orbit.  %Query Query: "What are the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning
pipeline?"  Helpful Answer: The following metrics were evaluated in our work: Precision, Recall,
Accuracy, F-Beta Score, and Categorical Cross Entropy.  %Query Query: "What are the results of the
deep learning pipeline?"  Helpful Answer: In the experiment, a training loss of 6.88%, training
accuracy of 97.35% and testing accuracy of 96.71% were obtained. Also, an F-beta score of 92.69% was
obtained. The F-beta score is a weighted harmonic mean of the precision and recall. An F-beta score
reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0.  %Query Query: "What are the future works that can
be done to improve the deep learning pipeline?"  Helpful Answer: A few additions may be made to this
work for improvements mentioned below: Using a larger neural network is likely to give a better
result. Models like ResNet and Inception, which are deeper in nature may give better results than
the VGG16 model. Also, the dataset may help in better classiÔ¨Åcation. In this work, it has been shown
how resizing the provided image to 128x128 pixels can be made to obtain good performance. No
preprocessing involving the texture and nature of the image itself was performed. Performing data
augmentation to make the system more robust may be another way of getting better results. Since the
satellite images may vary in terms of lighting effect, rotation, shifting, etc., it may be a good
idea to perform data augmentation to enlarge the dataset for better training. These things may be
investigated in the upcoming future to improve the accuracy and robustness of this model.
