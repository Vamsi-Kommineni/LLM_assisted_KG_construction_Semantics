 The authors used a diverse dataset from the Indicator Bats Programme (iBats) [7] and generated
annotations of the start time of search-phase bat echolocation calls in the acoustic recordings by
uploading the acoustic data to the Zooniverse citizen science platform (www.zooniverse.org) as part
of the Bat Detective project (www.batdetective.org). The audio data were first split up into 3.84s
long sound clips to include the 3.2s of TE audio and buffered by sensor-listening silence on either
side. Each sound clip was then uploaded as both a wav file and a magnitude spectrogram image
(represented as a 512x720 resolution image) onto the Bat Detective project website. The original
recordings were time-expanded, therefore reducing the frequency, sounds in the files were in the
audible spectrum and could be easily heard by users. Users were presented with a spectrogram and its
corresponding audio file, and asked to annotate the presence of bat calls in each 3.84s clip
(corresponding to 320ms of real-time recordings). The authors also mention that in future, extending
the training dataset to include annotated bat calls from verified species-call databases to increase
geographic and taxonomic coverage, will further improve the generality of their detection tool.
