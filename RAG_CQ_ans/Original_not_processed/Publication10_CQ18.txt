 The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly
mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that during training, the binary mask of
the spectrograms corresponding to recordings that do not include bird vocalizations are mapped to an
empty figure. This suggests that the model's performance is monitored by evaluating its ability to
correctly identify and segment bird vocalizations in the spectrograms.
