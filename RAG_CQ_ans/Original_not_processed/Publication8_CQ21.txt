 The postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned in the
provided context. However, based on the context, we can infer that the model performance was
evaluated using visual inspection and the Average Precision (AP) metric. The Average Precision
metric was calculated for each type of organ and for the entire dataset. Additionally, the model was
tested on a different un-annotated dataset, and the predicted bounding boxes were manually annotated
to evaluate the model's performance. The context does not mention the use of saliency maps or
confusion matrix for postprocessing.
