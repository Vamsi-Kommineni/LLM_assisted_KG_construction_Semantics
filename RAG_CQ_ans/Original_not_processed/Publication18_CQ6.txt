 Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These
can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is a technique used to change the
values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the
ranges of values or losing information. Scaling is a feature scaling technique in which the values
of numeric columns in the dataset are adjusted to a certain range, typically between 0 and 1.
Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in the
dataset. Other preprocessing steps can include data augmentation, which involves creating new data
by applying transformations to the existing data, and transfer learning, which involves using a pre-
trained model as a starting point for training a new model.
