 The purpose of the deep learning model is to classify bat species based on their acoustic signals.
The model, called BatNet, is used in the software program "Waveman" and is designed to outperform
other published networks such as CNNFULL, VggNet, and ResNet_v2. The model has an overall accuracy
of over 90% and an AUC of 0.94 on the ROC plot. The classification accuracy rates for all 36 species
are at least 86% when analyzed in combination. The model is also used to identify Hipposideros
larvatus and Rhinolophus siamensis from three different environments.
