 The study used data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site at the San Joaquin
Experimental Range in California. The site contains an open woodland of live oak (Quercus
agrifolia), blue oak (Quercus douglasii), and foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana) forest. The majority
of the site is a single-story canopy with mixed understory of herbaceous vegetation. The data
collection method is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but it can be inferred that
the data was collected using remote sensing methods, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and
RGB imagery.
