 The deep learning pipeline uses the CitySounds2017 dataset, an expert-annotated dataset of urban
sounds collected across Greater London, UK. This dataset was used to train the CNNs, CityBioNet and
CityAnthroNet, for measuring audible (0-12 kHz) biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in audio
recordings from urban environments.
