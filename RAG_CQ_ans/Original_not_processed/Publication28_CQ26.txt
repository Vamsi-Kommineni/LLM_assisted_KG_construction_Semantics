 The techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include
stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting
is a method of splitting the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining the same
distribution of classes in both sets. Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of
instances in the minority class by duplicating them, while undersampling is used to decrease the
number of instances in the majority class by removing some of them. Diverse data collection involves
collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.
