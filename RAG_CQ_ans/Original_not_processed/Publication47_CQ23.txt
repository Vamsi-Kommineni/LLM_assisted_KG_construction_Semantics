 To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. The model
was trained on a diverse dataset that included all species with an IUCN Red List assessment and
available occurrence records. The data set was then randomly split into a training set (90% of the
entries) and a test set (10%). Additionally, 20% of the training set was used for validation. To
further improve the model's generalizability, cross-validation was performed by shifting the
validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. The
neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models with different numbers of
hidden layers and subsets of features was then used to predict the conservation status of all orchid
species.
