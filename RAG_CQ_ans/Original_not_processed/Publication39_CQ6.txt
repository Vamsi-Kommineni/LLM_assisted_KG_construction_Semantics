 The context does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep
learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization,
scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves scaling the input features to a range between 0 and 1
or -1 and 1. Scaling involves resizing the input features to a fixed size. Cleaning involves
removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data.
