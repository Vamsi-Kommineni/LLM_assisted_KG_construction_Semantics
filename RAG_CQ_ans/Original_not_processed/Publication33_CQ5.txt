 The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are T0, T1, and T2. T0 is the training dataset
composed of 691,690 images, T1 is the dataset used to tune the thresholds containing 6,320 images,
and T2 is the test dataset containing 13,232 images. These datasets are not standard datasets like
MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but are specifically created for this study case to identify 20 fish
species from underwater images on coral reefs.
