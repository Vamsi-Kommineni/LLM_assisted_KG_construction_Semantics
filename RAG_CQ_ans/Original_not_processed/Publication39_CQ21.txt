 The postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned in the
provided context. However, it is mentioned that the evaluation metrics used are the official COCO
evaluation metrics, following Lin et al. (2014) and Everingham et al. (2010). These metrics include
the calculation of the Intersection over Union (IoU) for bounding boxes and segmentation masks.
Additionally, the use of confidence scores for each bounding box or segmentation mask prediction is
mentioned. It is also stated that the evaluation results are depicted in tables and figures, which
suggests that metrics calculation is a postprocessing step. However, the context does not provide
information on the use of saliency maps or confusion matrix.
