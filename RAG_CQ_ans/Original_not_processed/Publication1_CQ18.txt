 The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a validation
set to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch. The validation set is a subset of the
training data that is not used to train the model, but only to evaluate its performance. This allows
the model to be evaluated on data that it has not seen before, which can help to prevent
overfitting. Additionally, the validation set can be used to tune the model's hyperparameters, such
as the learning rate or the number of layers in the network.  Answer: The strategy implemented to
