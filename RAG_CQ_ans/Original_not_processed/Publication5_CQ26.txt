 The context does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during
preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data
bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets, or strata, based on certain
characteristics and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. Oversampling involves
duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from
the majority class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources to
ensure that the data is representative of the population being studied.
