 The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before
training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps in deep learning include
normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization scales the data to a specific range, typically
between 0 and 1, to ensure that all features have the same scale. Scaling involves rescaling the
data to a specific range, such as -1 to 1 or 0 to 1. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any
errors or inconsistencies in the data.
