 The paper does not explicitly mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of
the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
However, it does mention that accurate tree detection will likely be region-specific and that the
best model will vary among environments. This suggests that the authors acknowledge the need for
training a new model for each geographic area using both RGB and LIDAR training data. Additionally,
the paper mentions that the National Ecological Observatory Network has 45 forested NEON sites that
could serve as pools of LIDAR and RGB data at 10,000 ha scales for regional model training. This
could potentially improve the generalizability of the model by training it on a more diverse
dataset.
