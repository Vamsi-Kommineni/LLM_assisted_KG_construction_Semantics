 The context does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning
model training. However, it is common practice to split the data into training, validation, and
testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune
hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final
performance of the model. The split is often done randomly, but it can also be done in a stratified
manner to ensure that each set has a similar distribution of classes.  %Query Query: "What is the
size of the kernel used in the convolution layer of the CNN architecture?"  Helpful Answer: The
context does not provide specific information on the size of the kernel used in the convolution
layer of the CNN architecture. However, it does mention that the size of the kernel could be
anything from 3 × 3 to 5 × 5 to 7 × 7.  %Query Query: "What is the purpose of the pooling layer in
the CNN architecture?"  Helpful Answer: The pooling layer in the CNN architecture offers
downsampling functionality that decreases the dimensionality of the feature maps to achieve
translation invariance to the alterations and the biases incorporated. It helps in reducing the
number of learnable parameters and offers the CNN with variable sized input.  %Query Query: "What is
the activation function used in the fully connected layer of the CNN architecture?"  Helpful Answer:
The activation function used in the fully connected layer of the CNN architecture is the ReLU
(Rectified Linear Unit) function.  %Query Query: "What is the performance evaluation metric used for
the species probability distribution model?"  Helpful Answer: The performance evaluation metric used
for the species probability distribution model is the AUC (Area Under ROC (Receiver Operating
Characteristics) Curve). It is generated by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) versus the False
Positive Rate (FPR) at varied thresholds. The closer the value is to 1, the better the prediction
is.
