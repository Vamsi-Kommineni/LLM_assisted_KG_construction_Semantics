 The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include resizing the images
to a standard size, in this case, 128x128 pixels. This step is important as it helps in speeding up
the training. In this dataset, 40479 images for training and 40669 images for testing were used.
Each image may be classified into multiple classes. No preprocessing involving the texture and
nature of the image itself was performed.
