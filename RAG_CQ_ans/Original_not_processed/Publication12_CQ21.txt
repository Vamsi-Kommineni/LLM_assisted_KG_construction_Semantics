 After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved include using the validation dataset to
evaluate the performance of the four models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area
under the curve (AUC), overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and false positive rate were
calculated using Python package sklearn and plotted using package matplotlib. A confusion matrix was
also used to evaluate the taxonomic bias of the four networks using the package sklearn. To check
whether closely genetically related taxa impact on the identification for the four networks, a
phylogenetic tree was also drawn to illustrate genetic relationships among the taxa. The phylogeny
was reconstructed using six mitochondrial genes from the 36 species extracted from public database
GenBank. A maximum likelihood method was adopted using a software called RAxML v8.2.2 with GRT+Î“
model and 200 bootstraps to build the phylogeny. The acoustic traits sweep-rate and frequency traits
were extracted using Sonobat V4.2.2 and plotted using R packages picante and Geiger.
