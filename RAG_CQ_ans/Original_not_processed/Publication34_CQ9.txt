10.3.3.1 Fresh Water: BDCarthage, Version 1.2, 01/2017  The BDCarthage database is a French national
database of watercourses and hydrographic surfaces. It is a vector database containing polygons
representing watercourses, and polygons representing hydrographic fresh surfaces. The data has been
produced by the Institut National de l’information Géographique et forestière (IGN) from an
interpretation of the BD Ortho IGN. It is maintained by the SANDRE under free license for non-proﬁt
use and downloadable at: http://services.sandre.eaufrance.fr/telechargement/geo/ETH/BDCarthage/FX
From this shapeﬁle, we derived a raster containing the binary value of variable proxi_eau, i.e.
proximity to fresh water, all over France. We used qgis to rasterize to a 12.5 m resolution, with a
buffer of 50 m, the shapeﬁle COURS_D_EAU.shp on one hand, and the polygons of
*SURFACES_HYDROGRAPHIQUES.shp with attribute NATURE=“Eau douce permanente” on the other hand. We
then created the maximum raster of the previous ones (So the value of 1 correspond to an approximate
distance of less than 50 m to a watercourse or hydrographic surface of fresh water).  10.3.3.2 Soil:
European Soil Database v2.0, 2004  The European Soil Database (ESDB) is a 1:1,000,000 scale digital
soil map of Europe and adjacent countries. It was compiled at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the
European Commission during the period 1985–2004. The ESDB is a harmonized soil database, which means
that the soil information is organized in a standardized way. The ESDB is based on the Revised
Legend of the FAO-UNESCO Soil Map of the World (FAO, 1988). The ESDB is a raster database, with a
spatial resolution of 1 km. The ESDB is available in two versions: the ESDBv1 and the ESDBv2. The
ESDBv2 is an update of the ESDBv1, which was released in 2004. The ESDBv2 is available for download
at: http://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/european-soil-database-v20 The ESDBv2 contains information
on the following soil properties: soil texture, soil depth, soil organic carbon content, soil pH,
soil cation exchange capacity, soil bulk density, soil available water capacity, soil hydraulic
conductivity, soil erodibility, soil suitability for agriculture, soil suitability for forestry,
soil suitability for nature conservation, soil suitability for urban development, soil suitability
for recreation, soil suitability for tourism, soil suitability for mining, soil suitability for
industry, soil suitability for transport, soil suitability for energy production, soil suitability
