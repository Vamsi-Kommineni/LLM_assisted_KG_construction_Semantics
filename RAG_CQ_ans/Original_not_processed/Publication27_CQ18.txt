 The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a validation
set and evaluate the model on this set after each epoch. The validation loss is then plotted to
visualize the model's performance over time. Additionally, the model's performance on the validation
set is used to determine when to stop training to prevent overfitting.
