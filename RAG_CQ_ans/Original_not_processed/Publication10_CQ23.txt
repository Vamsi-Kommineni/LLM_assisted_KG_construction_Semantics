 The context does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the
generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model uses a data
augmentation procedure that contributes significantly to the final accuracy. This procedure involves
small random rotations between -5 and 5 degrees as well as random displacements at the maximum of
the 10% of the image. This could be considered as a measure to ensure the model's ability to
generalize to new data.
