 The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing
of the deep learning pipeline. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include
stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting
involves splitting the data into training and testing sets while maintaining the same distribution
of classes in both sets. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority
class, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of instances in the majority class.
Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the model
is trained on a diverse set of data.
