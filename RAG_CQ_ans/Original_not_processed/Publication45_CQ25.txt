 The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on
the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for prediction,
specifically for predicting bark beetle outbreaks in conifer-dominated forests. The model is a deep
feedforward neural network, which is a type of deep learning model often used for pattern
recognition in images or time series data. The model is trained to minimize prediction error over a
training data set, and its accuracy is gauged using a test data set. The details of the network
architecture and parameters of the training process are usually problem-specific.
