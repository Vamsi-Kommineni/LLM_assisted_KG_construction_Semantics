 The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation
and instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of
interest in an image, while instance segmentation involves drawing a precise boundary around the
object of interest. The Sashimi toolkit uses the Mask R- CNN architecture, which is an extension of
the Faster R- CNN algorithm, to perform instance segmentation. This allows the model to not only
detect the presence or absence of a target in an image but also to isolate the specific pixels
encapsulating that target. The model is trained using transfer learning against the 328,000 image
COCO dataset.
