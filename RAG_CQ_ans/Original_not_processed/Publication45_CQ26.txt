 The context does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during
preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques include stratified
splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting ensures
that the distribution of classes in the training and test sets is representative of the overall
dataset. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the number of samples in each
class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the
model is not biased towards a particular type of data.
