 The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed
value, include setting a fixed seed value for reproducibility, using techniques like cross-
validation, and employing ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's
performance.  Answer: The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline,
