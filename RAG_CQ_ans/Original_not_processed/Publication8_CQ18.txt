 The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly
mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained using
Stochastic Gradient Descent optimiser with a learning rate of 0.0025 and momentum of 0.9. This
suggests that the model performance was likely monitored using metrics such as loss and accuracy
during training.
