 The provided context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps before training the deep
learning model. However, it does mention that the acquired audio files are segmented into 15-second
windows and passed to a feature extractor function where MFCC is used to return the extracted
features for the classifier. This can be considered as a form of preprocessing.  Reference(s): [1]
