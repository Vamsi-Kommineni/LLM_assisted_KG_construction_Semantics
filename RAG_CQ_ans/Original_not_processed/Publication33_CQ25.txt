 The purpose of the deep learning model is for classification, specifically for identifying fish
species. The model is a 100-layer CNN based on the TensorFlow implementation of ResNet, which
achieved the best results on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition in 2015. The
model is used to classify fish images extracted from videos into 20 different fish species. The last
layer of the architecture is a "softmax" layer, which converts image descriptors into a list of
scores for each learned class, with the sum of all scores equal to 1. The class with the highest
score is the predicted class for a given image. The model is trained on a given database and then a
risk threshold is tuned for each class using a second and independent database. The goal is to
transform the 2 classification options (correct, wrong) into 3 options by applying certain
equations. The purpose of this is to accept or reject the classification decision of the CNN based
on the similarity between an unknown image and the images used for training. The higher the
similarity, the stronger the activation in the CNN during the classification process, and thus, the
more robust the classification is.
