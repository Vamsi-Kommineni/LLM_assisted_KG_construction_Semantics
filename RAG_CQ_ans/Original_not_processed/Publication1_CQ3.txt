 The paper does not provide specific details on the data annotation techniques used in the deep
learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the system presents high probability events in a
nonlinear-time presentation and allows analysis to repeatedly review complex or ambiguous events.
The software is used to perform three specific tasks: (1) tools for audio and image data exploration
to search for expected species and flag unknown or unexpected events, (2) creating labeled datasets
to train and refine DL models, and (3) manually reviewing and auditing the output of existing DL
models trained to classify events of interest. These tasks suggest that the data annotation
techniques used may include labeling events of interest, flagging unknown or unexpected events, and
possibly using bounding boxes or instance segmentation for image data. However, the paper does not
provide explicit confirmation of these techniques.
