 The deep learning pipeline uses a new network specifically for tropical bats, called BatNet, which
is incorporated into the software Waveman. BatNet has 22 convolutional layers for extracting useful
acoustic features and eight shortcut connections between layers to avoid the problem of information
loss as layer number increases. The key parameter settings of BatNet include a batch size equal to
64 and learning rate equal to 0.001. However, the context does not provide information on the
specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam.
