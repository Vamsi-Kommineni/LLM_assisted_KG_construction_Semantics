 The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by considering two factors: correct identification
rate and processing time. The optimum number of training steps was chosen as 4000 for all challenges
except Challenge 3, where 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number due to the higher
number of species (41 species). The details of the results associated with each classification task
are provided in the paper. However, the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such
as grid search or random search, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
