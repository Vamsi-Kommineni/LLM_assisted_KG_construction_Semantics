 The context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the
deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study uses spectrograms, which are visual
representations of audio signals, for species identification. Therefore, it can be inferred that the
data annotation technique used in this study is likely related to audio signal processing and
analysis.
