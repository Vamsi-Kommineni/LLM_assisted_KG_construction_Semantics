 The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured by training it on a diverse dataset and
evaluating its performance on an independent dataset. The model was trained twice, first on a
training subset of 498 images and then on all 653 annotated images. The performance of the model was
evaluated on a test subset of 155 images and then on another un-annotated independent dataset
consisting of 708 full scale herbarium scans from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR) with a
different set of species and geographical origins. This dataset is also available at GBIF
(Senckenberg 2020).
