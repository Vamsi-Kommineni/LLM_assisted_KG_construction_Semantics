patterns across the Korean Peninsula at a higher spatial resolution than the species survey data,
and for identifying which variables at which time periods are more important for estimating plant
species richness, and for developing a deep learning framework for estimating potential plant
species richness across the Korean Peninsula, and for comparing the results with independent tree
plot datasets from the Korea Forest Service, and for identifying the main challenges faced in the
study, and for identifying the potential applications of the study?"  Helpful Answer: The main
findings of the study in relation to the use of deep learning for estimating potential plant species
richness patterns across the Korean Peninsula at a higher spatial resolution than the species survey
data, and for identifying which variables at which time periods are more important for estimating
plant species richness, and for developing a deep learning framework for estimating potential plant
species richness across the Korean Peninsula, and for comparing the results with independent tree
plot datasets from the Korea Forest Service, and for identifying the main challenges faced in the
study, and for identifying the potential applications of the study are that the proposed models were
able to estimate potential plant species richness over the entire Korean Peninsula at a higher
resolution than in previous efforts, and that growing season NDVI-related features were more
important than LAI features for quantifying biodiversity from remote sensing time-series data.
