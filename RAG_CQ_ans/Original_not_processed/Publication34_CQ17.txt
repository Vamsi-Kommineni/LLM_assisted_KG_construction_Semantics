 The paper mentions the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep
learning pipeline. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during
training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. The paper also
mentions the use of L2 regularization, which is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss
function to prevent the weights from becoming too large. This helps to prevent overfitting by making
the model more generalizable.
