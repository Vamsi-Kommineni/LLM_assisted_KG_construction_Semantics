 The pipeline uses Batch Normalization (BNorm) layers to prevent overfitting. BNorm layers
standardize the parameters with batch images, which greatly alleviates the impact of high image
variability, including distortions or overlaps that can occur in recording and lead to errors
without proper processing. Thus, the model after batch normalized could be used to identify data
from wider regions.
