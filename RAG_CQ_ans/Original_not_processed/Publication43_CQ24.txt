 The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include using a fixed
random seed value, using deterministic algorithms, and using techniques such as batch normalization
and dropout to reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance. Additionally, ensemble
methods can be used to combine the predictions of multiple models trained with different random
seeds to improve the overall performance and robustness of the model.
