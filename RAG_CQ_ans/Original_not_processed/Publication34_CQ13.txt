 The deep learning model was fitted with the package mxnet. The model parameters were initialized
with a uniform distribution U (0.03, 0.03). A stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a momentum
of 0.9 was used. The batch-size was 50, with batch samples randomly chosen at each iteration. The
initial learning rate was critical for good optimization behavior and was set to 10âˆ’. The learning
rate was chosen to avoid training loss divergence when it was too big, and to prevent slow learning
when it was too small. The learning took approximately 5 min for SNN, 10 min for DNN, and 5 h for
CNN (independently of the version).
