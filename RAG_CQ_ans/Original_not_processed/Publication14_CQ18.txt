 The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly
mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model evaluation on the 70 test
videos completed in 4 hr and 38 min on 30 CPUs with an average frame rate of 17 frames/s. This
suggests that the model performance was monitored during training by evaluating it on a test
dataset.
