 The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline can vary depending on
the specific application. For surveys, methods such as aerial surveys, acoustic surveys, and visual
surveys from planes and helicopters can be used. For sensors, methods such as remote sensing and
satellite imagery can be used. Additionally, public datasets such as ImageNet, Microsoft COCO, and
Wildscreen Arkive can also be used as sources of raw data.
