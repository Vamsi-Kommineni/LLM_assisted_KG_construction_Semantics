 To improve the generalizability of the deep learning model, Ô¨Åne-tuning was used by initializing the
model with the pre-trained weights of ImageNet. Additionally, data augmentation techniques were
applied to increase the size of the dataset from 100 to 6000 images. These techniques included
Random scale, Random crop, Flip horizontally, and Random brightness.
