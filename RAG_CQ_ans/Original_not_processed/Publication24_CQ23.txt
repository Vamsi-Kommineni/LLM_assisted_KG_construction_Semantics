 To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the testing dataset was chosen from the
same sites as the training dataset, and it was found that this made little impact on the performance
of the algorithms. Additionally, multiple human labellers were used to create a single annotated
test dataset, which optimized the quality of the annotations. The resource intensity of this
technique prevented it from being used to create the larger training dataset. The CitySounds2017
annotated training and testing datasets are available.
