 Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These
can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning of the data. Normalization is the process of
rescaling the data to a standard range, often between 0 and 1, to ensure that all features have the
same scale and do not dominate others. Scaling is a similar process, but it rescales the data to a
specific range, such as -1 to 1. Cleaning the data involves removing or correcting any errors,
inconsistencies, or missing values in the data set. These preprocessing steps are important to
ensure that the model can accurately learn from the data and make reliable predictions.
