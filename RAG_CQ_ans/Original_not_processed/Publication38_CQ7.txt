 The data was split into training and test datasets. The training data was collected from time-
expanded (TE) data recorded along road transects by the Indicator Bats Programme (iBats) in Romania
and Bulgaria between 2006 and 2011. The test data was also collected from TE data recorded as part
of iBats car transects in the UK between 2005 and 2011, and from real-time recordings from static
recorders from the Norfolk Bat Survey from 2015. The test data was randomly chosen and the start
times of the search-phase echolocation calls in these three test sets were manually extracted. The
data contained a significantly greater proportion of negative (non-bat calls) as compared to
positive examples (bat calls).
