 The postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned in the
provided context. However, it is mentioned that raw outputs of the model T4 were post-processed
following decision rule r1 (i.e. environment not considered as a correct result), which improved
correct identification rate from 86.9 to 90.2%. Adding decision rule r2 (i.e. identification of a
part of a species considered as a correct answer) increased this success rate to 94.1%. Hence, post-
processing raw outputs of the model trained with the most complete dataset provided the best
identification rate. Among the 18 species, success rate ranged from 85.2 to 100%, with only 3
species being correctly identified in < 90% of cases and 9 species being correctly identified in >
95% of cases, including 3 with a correct identification rate > 99%. Confusions between 2 fish
species were lower than 4%. Confusion between a fish and the environment was common when no post-
processing was applied, but applying decision rule r1 decreased this error rate to < 4%.
