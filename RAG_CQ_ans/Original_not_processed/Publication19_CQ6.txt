 The context does not provide specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before
training the deep learning models. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models
include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation. Normalization and scaling help to
bring the data to a similar scale, while cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous data.
Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying
transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping.
