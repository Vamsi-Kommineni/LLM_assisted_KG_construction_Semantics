 The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. The
data set was randomly split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%). 20% of
the training set was used for validation. Cross-validation was performed by shifting the validation
set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. The neural network
with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers
and subsets of features was used to predict the conservation status of all orchid species.
