 The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model
training. However, it does mention that the output of the detector is a probability vector, which
suggests that the model's performance could be evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall,
and F1-score. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained using a subset of full-
spectrum time-expanded ultrasonic acoustic data, which suggests that the model's performance could
be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and error rate. The context also mentions that the model
was trained using annotations of the start time of search-phase bat echolocation calls in the
acoustic recordings, which suggests that the model's performance could be evaluated using metrics
such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error. However, the context does not provide
specific details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
