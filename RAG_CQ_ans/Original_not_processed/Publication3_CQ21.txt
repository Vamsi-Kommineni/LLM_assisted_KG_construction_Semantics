 After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are creating a confusion matrix to
depict TensorFlow's results, calculating the overall correct identification rate, and achieving 100%
correct identification rate for some species. The lowest identification rates were for closely-
related species, and no systematic errors were detected in TensorFlow classification.
