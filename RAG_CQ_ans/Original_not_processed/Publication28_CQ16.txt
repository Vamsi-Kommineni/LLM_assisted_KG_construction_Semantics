 The criteria used to determine when training is complete can vary depending on the specific model
and dataset. However, some common criteria include reaching a validation loss plateau, achieving a
desired level of accuracy or performance on a validation set, or reaching a maximum number of
training epochs. In the context of the PTDLEN-VAE model, it is not explicitly stated what criteria
are used to determine when training is complete.  %Query Query: "What is the structure of the
EfficientNet model used in the PTDLEN-VAE model?"  Helpful Answer: The structure of the EfficientNet
model used in the PTDLEN-VAE model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However,
EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural network (CNN) models that are designed to be more
efficient in terms of computational resources and model size while still achieving high accuracy.
The EfficientNet models use a compound scaling method to uniformly scale the depth, width, and
resolution of the network, and they are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The specific
EfficientNet model used in the PTDLEN-VAE model is not mentioned in the provided context.
