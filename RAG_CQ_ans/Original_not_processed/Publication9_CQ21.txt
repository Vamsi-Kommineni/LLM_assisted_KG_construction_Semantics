 After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved in the Sashimi toolkit include using
the trained model to segment new images, evaluating the segmentation performance using metrics such
as Intersection over Union (IoU) and pixel accuracy, and visualizing the segmentation results using
tools such as saliency maps. The toolkit also includes a script to aid users in qualitatively and
quantitatively assessing model performance for complementary sets of automatically and manually
segmented images. However, the specific postprocessing steps may vary depending on the use case and
the desired level of detail in the analysis.
