 The paper does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the
generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained
and tested on a diverse dataset, as the UCM dataset comprises a set of 100 images with 21 class
labels, and the AID multi-label dataset has 3000 RS images from the AID dataset. Additionally, the
paper mentions that the performance of the PTDLEN-VAE model is examined against these datasets,
which suggests that some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting may have been used to
evaluate the model's performance.
