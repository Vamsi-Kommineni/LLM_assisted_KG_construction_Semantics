 After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are metrics calculation and confusion
matrix. Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as
precision, recall, accuracy, and F-beta score. The confusion matrix is a table that is used to
describe the performance of a classification model. It has four components: true positives, true
negatives, false positives, and false negatives. These components are used to calculate the metrics.
Saliency maps are not mentioned as a postprocessing step in the provided context.
