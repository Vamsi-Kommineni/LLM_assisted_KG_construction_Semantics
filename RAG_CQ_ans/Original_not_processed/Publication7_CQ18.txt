 The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly
mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the classifier was trained on two-
thirds of the images from the year 2011 and tested on the remaining images from the same year, and
that the training set consisted of two-thirds of the images from the years 2011, 2012 and 2013,
whereas the test set consists of all the remaining images from the same years. This suggests that
the model performance was monitored by evaluating the classifier on a separate test set.
