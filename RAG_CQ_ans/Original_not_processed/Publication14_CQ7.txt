 The context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep
learning model training. However, it mentions that 70 half-day videos were selected for validation,
which were not used in the model training. This suggests that the data was split into training and
validation sets. The context does not mention a test set, but it is common practice in machine
learning to split the data into training, validation, and test sets. The criteria for splitting the
data can vary, but common methods include random sampling or stratified sampling to ensure that the
distribution of classes is similar in all sets.
