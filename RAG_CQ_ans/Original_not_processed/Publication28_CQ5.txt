 The performance of the PTDLEN-VAE model is examined against UCM dataset and AID dataset. The UCM
dataset comprises a set of 100 images with 21 class labels. Each image measures 256 Ã— 256 pixels.
The pixel resolution of this public domain imagery is 1 ft. Fig. 1 showcases the sample images from
UCM dataset. The AID multi-label dataset has 3000 RS images from the AID dataset.
