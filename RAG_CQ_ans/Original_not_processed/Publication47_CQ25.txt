 The purpose of the deep learning model, IUC-NN, is to predict the conservation status of
unevaluated orchid species. It is based on 4 groups of features derived from digitally available
occurrence records: geographic, climatic, biome, and phylogenetic. The model was implemented as an R
package and is based on the Python TensorFlow library.
