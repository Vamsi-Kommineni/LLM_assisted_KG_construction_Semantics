 The context does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during
preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques include stratified
splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting ensures
that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of classes. Oversampling and
undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in the dataset. Diverse data
collection involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the model generalizes well
to new data.
