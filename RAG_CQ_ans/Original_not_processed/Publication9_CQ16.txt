 The criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned in the
provided context. However, it is common in machine learning to use metrics such as validation loss
plateau or a predetermined number of epochs to determine when training is complete. Without
additional context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.  %INSTRUCTIONS: Use the
provided pieces of context to answer the query. If you don't know the answer, just say that you
don't know, don't try to make up an answer.  %Query Query: "What is the role of transfer learning in
this context?"  Helpful Answer: Transfer learning is used in this context to leverage the learned
features of a pre-trained neural network (in this case, COCO) to efficiently generalize to
segmenting novel categories of stimuli (e.g. fish) with only a few hundred training examples.
Without transfer learning, a significantly larger training dataset of many thousands of examples
would be necessary.
