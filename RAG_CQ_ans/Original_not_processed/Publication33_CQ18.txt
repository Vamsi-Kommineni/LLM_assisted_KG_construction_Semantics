 The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to stop the training
to prevent from overfitting. This is achieved by limiting the number of iterations to 600,000, with
each iteration processing a batch of 16 images. This means that the 691,690 images of the training
dataset were analyzed 14 times each by the network on average.
