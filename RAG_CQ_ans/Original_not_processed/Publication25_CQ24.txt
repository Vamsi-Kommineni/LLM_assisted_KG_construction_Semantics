 The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep
learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, common strategies for handling randomness in
deep learning include setting a fixed random seed value for reproducibility, using techniques like
ensemble learning to average out the effects of randomness, or employing deterministic algorithms
where possible.
