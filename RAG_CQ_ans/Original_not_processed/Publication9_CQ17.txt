the Sashimi toolkit?"  Helpful Answer: The Sashimi toolkit is a toolkit for automating and
evaluating image segmentation performance using the powerful deep learning meta-algorithm, Mask
R-CNN. It aims to simplify and streamline the image segmentation procedure from start-to-finish,
making model diagnostic metrics and visualization accessible with the 'click-of-a-button' and
promoting open-access sharing of clade-specific models to facilitate reproducible and efficient
research.
