 The performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are Mean Loss, Root Mean Square
Error (Rmse), and Accuracy on 10% Densest Quadrats (A10%DQ). These metrics are calculated for each
species and for two disjoints and randomly sampled subsets of sites: A train set (4781 sites) which
is used for Ô¨Åtting all models and a test set (400 sites) which aims at testing models generalization
capacities. Then, train and test metrics are averaged over the 50 species. The Mean loss is an
important metric to consider because it is relevant regarding the ecological model and it is the
objective function that is minimized during model training. The Root Mean Square Error (Rmse) is a
general error measure, which, in contrary to the previous one, is independent of the statistical
model. The Accuracy on 10% Densest Quadrats (A10%DQ) represents the proportion of sites which are in
the top 10% of all sites in term of both real count and model prediction. This is a meaningful
metric for many concrete scenarios where the regions of a territory have to be prioritized in terms
of decision or actions related to the ecology of species.
