 The criteria used to determine when training is complete can vary depending on the specific model
and task. However, some common criteria include:  1. Validation loss plateau: When the validation
loss stops decreasing and starts to plateau, it can be an indication that the model has learned as
much as it can from the training data. 2. Validation accuracy: If the validation accuracy stops
improving, it can be a sign that the model has reached its maximum performance on the validation
set. 3. Early stopping: This is a technique where training is stopped when the validation loss or
accuracy stops improving for a certain number of epochs. 4. Maximum number of epochs: Training can
also be stopped after a certain number of epochs, regardless of the validation loss or accuracy.
Ultimately, the choice of criteria will depend on the specific goals and requirements of the model
and task.
