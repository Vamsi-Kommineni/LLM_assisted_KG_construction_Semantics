 The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before
training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling,
and cleaning of the data. Normalization involves scaling numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1,
while scaling involves standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data.
