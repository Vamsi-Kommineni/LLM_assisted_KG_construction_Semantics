 The criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned in the
provided context. However, it is common in machine learning to use validation loss plateau as an
indicator that training is complete. This means that the model's performance on the validation
dataset has stopped improving, indicating that further training is unlikely to improve the model's
performance.
