 The trained deep learning model was deployed in an inferencing pipeline to record bird audio in a
realistic environment. This was achieved using a Samsung S10 deployed under a tree containing
nesting Common Wood Pigeons. Audio was recorded for a total of three minutes and uploaded to the
platform for classification. During deployment, 8 individual bird songs were detected. The model
achieved an accuracy of 0.83 for the train split and 0.74 for the test split. The deployment of the
model demonstrates that the system can be used in a practical way to automatically classify bird
sounds within their natural habitat. Although a Samsung S10 was used in the implementation, a broad
range of acoustic sensors could be integrated into the system to achieve the same effect. The
inferencing pipeline offers a scalable and cost-effective way to collect, process, and classify
acoustic audio samples.
