 After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are not explicitly mentioned in the
provided context. However, based on common practices in machine learning, the postprocessing steps
could include evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Additionally, a confusion matrix could be used to visualize the performance of the model. Saliency
maps are not typically used for postprocessing in this context, as they are more commonly used for
understanding the decisions made by a model, rather than for evaluating its performance.
