 The raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using full-spectrum time-expanded (TE)
ultrasonic acoustic data recorded between 2005–2011 along road-transects by citizen scientists as
part of the Indicator Bats Programme (iBats). The acoustic devices used were set to record using a
TE factor of 10, a sampling time of 320ms, and sensitivity set on maximum, giving a continuous
sequence of ‘snapshots’, consisting of 320ms of silence (sensor listening) and 3.2s of TE audio
(sensor playing back x 10). As sensitivity was set at maximum, and no minimum amplitude trigger
mechanism was used on the recording devices, the recorded audio data contained many instances of low
amplitude and faint bat calls, as well as other night-time ‘background’ noises such as other biotic,
abiotic, and anthropogenic sounds.
