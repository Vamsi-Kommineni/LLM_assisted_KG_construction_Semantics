Named Entities:
DataFormat: images
DataAugmentationTechnique: Flipping, Rotating, Scaling, Shearing
Dataset: dataset created from images of different individual insects, annotated with bounding boxes, scaled to 72,000 images after augmentation, 80% used for training, 20% for validation
PreprocessingStep: image resizing to 128 × 128 pixels, pixel value scaling to range 0-1, removal of images with no insects
