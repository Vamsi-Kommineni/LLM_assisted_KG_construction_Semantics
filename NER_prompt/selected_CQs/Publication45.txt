        Below are the competency questions and answers: 
CQ: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, image, audio, video, csv)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses image data for predicting bark beetle disturbance from infestation maps. The network is asked to classify the focal cell of an example image either as disturbed or undisturbed.

CQ: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data augmentation techniques in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping.

CQ: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.

CQ: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps in machine learning include normalization, scaling, and cleaning of data. Normalization is the process of rescaling the data to a common range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling is the process of adjusting the values of a dataset to a specific range or unit. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in the data. These steps are important to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for training a deep learning model.

CQ: What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?
Answer: The code repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not provided in the given context. Please provide more information or check the original source for the code repository link.

CQ: What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?
Answer: The pipeline uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with five convolution layers, followed by five fully connected layers and a final softmax layer for classification.

CQ: What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer.

CQ: What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?
Answer: The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

CQ: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting  in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, common regularization methods used in deep learning include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to prevent overfitting. Other regularization methods include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation.

CQ: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model.

CQ: Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that a steep increase in available computing power has contributed to the development of deep learning.

CQ: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, conditional kappa, and true skill statistic. These metrics are used in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, as shown in Table 2.

CQ: What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for prediction, specifically for predicting bark beetle outbreaks in conifer-dominated forests. The model is a deep feedforward neural network, which is a type of deep learning model often used for pattern recognition in images or time series data. The model is trained to minimize prediction error over a training data set, and its accuracy is gauged using a test data set. The details of the network architecture and parameters of the training process are usually problem-specific.
