        Below are the competency questions and answers: 
CQ: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, image, audio, video, csv)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses image data format. The input images are resized to 300 × 300 resolution for the single-leaf classifier and 512 × 512 resolution for the semantic segmentation model. The segmentation model uses DeepLabv3+ with ResNet-101 as the feature extractor, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The single-leaf classifier uses a pre-trained VGG16 network, also trained on the ImageNet dataset. Both models are implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend.

CQ: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?
Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments.

CQ: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the segmentation model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on the dataset. Final

CQ: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include resizing the input images and their annotations to a 512 × 512 resolution to reduce computational cost during training. Rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments are applied as augmentation techniques for better network generalization. The model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on the dataset. An Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and a batch size of 3 is used. The model is trained for 100 epochs with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Mask post-processing is also applied to solve the problem of under-segmentation of closely placed leaves.

CQ: What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?
Answer: I'm sorry, the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline.

CQ: What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?
Answer: The pipeline uses a deep learning model called DeepLabv3+, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). %Context Context: The pipeline uses a deep learning model called DeepLabv3+, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). DeepLabv3+ is used for semantic segmentation tasks, such as identifying and segmenting individual leaves in herbarium sheet images. The model is pre- trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on the dataset. It uses an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and a batch size of 3. The model is trained for 100 epochs with a binary cross-entropy loss function as it is a binary class problem (leaf or background).

CQ: What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?
Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows: For the segmentation model: - Input dimension: 512 × 512 - Batch size: 3 - Learning rate: 1 × 10−4 - Optimizer: Adam optimizer - Loss function: Binary cross-entropy - Epochs: 100 - Pre-trained network: ResNet-101 For the single- leaf classifier: - Input dimension: Not specified - Batch size: 32 - Learning rate: 1 × 10−4 - Optimizer: Adam optimizer - Loss function: Binary cross-entropy - Epochs: 100 - Pre-trained network: VGG16 The hyperparameters for the Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5s models are not provided in the given context.

CQ: What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?
Answer: The Faster R-CNN network uses a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 0. 00025. The YOLOv5s network uses an Adam optimizer with an initial image size of 640 × 640 and a batch size of 16. The single-leaf classifier uses an Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 1 × 10−4.

CQ: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting  in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The provided context does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.

CQ: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model.
