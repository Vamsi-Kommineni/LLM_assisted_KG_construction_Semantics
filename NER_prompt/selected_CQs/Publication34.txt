        Below are the competency questions and answers: 
CQ: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, image, audio, video, csv)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses data in the form of CSV files.

CQ: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query.

CQ: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g, MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the context does mention that the models are fitted with the package mxnet, which is a deep learning framework that can be used with various datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. Without more specific information, it is not possible to determine which datasets were used in this particular case.

CQ: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning of the data. Normalization involves scaling numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling involves standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data.

CQ: What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?
Answer: The code repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not provided in the given context. 

CQ: What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?
Answer: The pipeline uses a deep feedforward network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) as deep learning models. The DNN has multiple hidden layers, and the CNN is composed of two hidden convolutional layers and one last layer fully connected with 200 neurons.

CQ: What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?
Answer: The deep learning model was fitted with the package mxnet. The model parameters were initialized with a uniform distribution U (0. 03, 0. 03). A stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a momentum of 0. 9 was used. The batch-size was 50, with batch samples randomly chosen at each iteration. The initial learning rate was critical for good optimization behavior and was set to 10−. The learning rate was chosen to avoid training loss divergence when it was too big, and to prevent slow learning when it was too small. The learning took approximately 5 min for SNN, 10 min for DNN, and 5 h for CNN (independently of the version).

CQ: What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?
Answer: The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a momentum of 0. 9.

CQ: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting  in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The paper mentions the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. The paper also mentions the use of L2 regularization, which is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent the weights from becoming too large. This helps to prevent overfitting by making the model more generalizable.

CQ: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The experiments were conducted using the R framework (version 3. 3. 2). The deep learning models were built using the mxnet library, which is a C++ library for learning deep neural network models and is deployed as an R package. It integrates a high-level symbolic language for quickly building customized models and loss functions, and automatically distributes calculations under CPUs or GPUs.

CQ: Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. %Query

CQ: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are Mean Loss, Root Mean Square Error (Rmse), and Accuracy on 10% Densest Quadrats (A10%DQ). These metrics are calculated for each species and for two disjoints and randomly sampled subsets of sites: A train set (4781 sites) which is used for ﬁtting all models and a test set (400 sites) which aims at testing models generalization capacities. Then, train and test metrics are averaged over the 50 species. The Mean loss is an important metric to consider because it is relevant regarding the ecological model and it is the objective function that is minimized during model training. The Root Mean Square Error (Rmse) is a general error measure, which, in contrary to the previous one, is independent of the statistical model. The Accuracy on 10% Densest Quadrats (A10%DQ) represents the proportion of sites which are in the top 10% of all sites in term of both real count and model prediction. This is a meaningful metric for many concrete scenarios where the regions of a territory have to be prioritized in terms of decision or actions related to the ecology of species.

CQ: What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to learn a function that takes the environmental feature vector of a given location as input and outputs an estimate of the abundance of the species. The main underlying hypothesis is that the abundance function is related to the fundamental ecological niche of the species, in the sense of Hutchinson. That means that in theory, a given species is likely to live in a single privileged ecological niche, characterized by an unimodal distribution in the environmental space. However, in reality, the abundance function is expected to be more complex. Many phenomena can actually affect the distribution of the species relative to its so called abiotic preferences. For instance, environment perturbations, or geographical constraints, or interactions with other living organisms (including humans) might have encourage specimens of that species to live in a different environment. As a consequence, the realized ecological niche of a species can be much more diverse and complex than its hypothetical fundamental niche.
