        Below are the competency questions and answers: 
CQ1: What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)?
Answer: The study utilizes over 880 audio-files from 36 Asian bat species for the deep learning pipeline. The raw data is collected through audio recordings of bat calls. The specific methods for collecting these audio recordings are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

CQ2: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?
Answer: The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are images. The images were manually assigned into the four categories and then converted to 64*64 pixels to save training time and reduce high memory graphics use. The size-reduced images were packaged into two datasets: training dataset with 85% of images and validation dataset with 15% using a Python script Making\_dataset. py in Waveman.

CQ3: What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that images were manually assigned into four categories, which suggests that some form of manual annotation was used.

CQ4: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that signals were rescaled exponentially and shifted the window slightly either side of the call to change background noise. These techniques could be considered as data augmentation techniques.

CQ5: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the validation dataset included 19,614 images. The context also mentions that the images were manually assigned into four categories and that the size-reduced images were packaged into two datasets: training dataset with 85% of images (111,244/130,858) and validation dataset with 15% (19,614/130,858). It is also mentioned that the images were converted to 64*64 pixels to save training time and reduce high memory graphics use.

CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model uses batch normalization to standardize the parameters with batch images, which greatly alleviates the impact of high image variability including distortions or overlaps. This suggests that preprocessing steps such as normalization and cleaning may be involved, but the specifics are not mentioned.

CQ7: What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?
Answer: The data was split into a training dataset with 85% of images (111,244/130,858) and a validation dataset with 15% (19,614/130,858) using a Python script Making_dataset. py in Waveman. The images were manually assigned into four categories: strong, weak, no call, and background noise. The weak and no call categories contained 10-100 images from each audio-file of different species. The images with a size of 256*256 pixels were converted to 64*64 pixels to save training time and reduce high memory graphics use. To balance the image number for all the species, an upper limit was provided for when a species had too much data. A method was also developed to increase the number of images for the rare species, in which signals were rescaled exponentially, and the window was shifted slightly either side of the call to change background noise. Both these measures ensure rare species with small image numbers will not be under-represented and under-classified relative to common species.

CQ8: Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?
Answer: The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know where the code repository is available.

CQ9: Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?
Answer: The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know where the data repository is available.

CQ10: What is the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?
Answer: I'm sorry, the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline.

CQ11: What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?
Answer: I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.

CQ12: What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?
Answer: The pipeline uses a deep learning model called BatNet, which is a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction from low-level features and syntheses to high- level features. The model is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

CQ13: What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?
Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is common to use hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and number of epochs in deep learning models. Without specific information, I cannot provide the exact hyperparameters used in this case.

CQ14: How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.

CQ15: What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses a new network specifically for tropical bats, called BatNet, which is incorporated into the software Waveman. BatNet has 22 convolutional layers for extracting useful acoustic features and eight shortcut connections between layers to avoid the problem of information loss as layer number increases. The key parameter settings of BatNet include a batch size equal to 64 and learning rate equal to 0. 001. However, the context does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam.

CQ16: What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?
Answer: The criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is common in machine learning to use validation loss plateau as an indicator that training is complete. This means that the model's performance on the validation dataset has stopped improving, indicating that further training is unlikely to improve the model's performance.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The pipeline uses Batch Normalization (BNorm) layers to prevent overfitting. BNorm layers standardize the parameters with batch images, which greatly alleviates the impact of high image variability, including distortions or overlaps that can occur in recording and lead to errors without proper processing. Thus, the model after batch normalized could be used to identify data from wider regions.

CQ18: What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the ReChk strategy. This strategy involves collecting bat calls with different strengths and using them to test the model generated by BatNet. The experiment is carried out in an eight-meter-long corridor covered with plants where bats can fly freely. Two recorders are placed near the corridor, one upto six meters away from the axis of the corridor and another inside the corridor. Bats are released individually and both recorders are utilized simultaneously. Fifteen bat species are used in the experiment, including five vespertilionid species, five hipposiderid species, and five rhinolophid species. Three species are relatively hard to trap using harptraps in the main site.

CQ19: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow. The context provided does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention that models were trained in the GPU for the four networks, which suggests that a deep learning framework was used. TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework that supports GPU training, so it is a reasonable assumption that TensorFlow was used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, the helpful answer is: The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow.

CQ20: Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?
Answer: The models were trained in the GPU for the four networks as mentioned above. %Explanation The context mentions that the models were trained in the GPU for the four networks, which includes BatNet. Therefore, the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model is GPU.

CQ21: What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?
Answer: After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved include using the validation dataset to evaluate the performance of the four models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and false positive rate were calculated using Python package sklearn and plotted using package matplotlib. A confusion matrix was also used to evaluate the taxonomic bias of the four networks using the package sklearn. To check whether closely genetically related taxa impact on the identification for the four networks, a phylogenetic tree was also drawn to illustrate genetic relationships among the taxa. The phylogeny was reconstructed using six mitochondrial genes from the 36 species extracted from public database GenBank. A maximum likelihood method was adopted using a software called RAxML v8. 2. 2 with GRT+Γ model and 200 bootstraps to build the phylogeny. The acoustic traits sweep-rate and frequency traits were extracted using Sonobat V4. 2 and plotted using R packages picante and Geiger.

CQ22: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and false positive rate. These metrics are calculated using Python package sklearn and plotted using package matplotlib. Additionally, a confusion matrix is used to evaluate the taxonomic bias of the four networks using the package sklearn.

CQ23: What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?
Answer: The study used a diverse dataset that included unfiltered audio-files recorded in different environments, such as nature habitats and human living areas. The dataset contained signal regions full of echos, background noises, and high intra-species acoustic variation. To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the study introduced dataset-with-weak and ReChk strategy, which greatly reduced the false positive and misidentification rate. Additionally, BNorm layers were added to standardize the parameters with batch images, which alleviated the impact of high image variability and allowed the model to identify data from wider regions.

CQ24: What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?
Answer: The provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. Therefore, I don't know the answer based on the given context.

CQ25: What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to classify bat species based on their acoustic signals. The model, called BatNet, is used in the software program "Waveman" and is designed to outperform other published networks such as CNNFULL, VggNet, and ResNet_v2. The model has an overall accuracy of over 90% and an AUC of 0. 94 on the ROC plot. The classification accuracy rates for all 36 species are at least 86% when analyzed in combination. The model is also used to identify Hipposideros larvatus and Rhinolophus siamensis from three different environments.

CQ26: What techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection)?
Answer: The techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting ensures that the training and validation datasets have a similar distribution of classes. Oversampling and undersampling are used to balance the number of images for all species. Diverse data collection is used to increase the number of images for rare species.

CQ27: What process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model (e.g., Model serialization, Platform selection)?
Answer: The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the models were trained in the GPU for the four networks (BatNet, CNNFULL, VggNet, and ResNet_v2). It is also mentioned that the package sklearn was used to calculate and plot the performance metrics of the models. Therefore, it can be inferred that the trained deep learning models were deployed using the GPU and the sklearn package in Python. However, the specific process of model serialization or platform selection is not mentioned.

CQ28: Which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
