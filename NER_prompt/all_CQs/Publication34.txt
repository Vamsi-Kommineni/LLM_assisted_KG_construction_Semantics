        Below are the competency questions and answers: 
CQ1: What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)?
Answer: The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. For instance, the study uses the INPN dataset, which is a public dataset, to collect raw data. Additionally, the study uses the CHELSA dataset, which is a public dataset, to collect raw data. Furthermore, the study uses the European Soil Database, which is a public dataset, to collect raw data.

CQ2: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses data in the form of CSV files.

CQ3: What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

CQ4: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a helpful answer to this query.

CQ5: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the context does mention that the models are fitted with the package mxnet, which is a deep learning framework that can be used with various datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. Without more specific information, it is not possible to determine which datasets were used in this particular case.

CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning of the data. Normalization involves scaling numeric columns to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling involves standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant data.

CQ7: What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?
Answer: The data is split into a train set (4781 sites) which is used for fitting all models and a test set (400 sites) which aims at testing models generalization capacities. The split is done randomly.

CQ8: Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?
Answer: The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know where it is available.

CQ9: Where is the data repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?
Answer: The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on GBIF. org. %Context Context: 10. 3. 1 Fresh Water: BDCarthage, Version 1. 2, 01/2017 The BDCarthage database is a French national database of watercourses and hydrographic surfaces. It is a vector database containing polygons representing watercourses, and polygons representing hydrographic fresh surfaces. The data has been produced by the Institut National de l’information Géographique et forestière (IGN) from an interpretation of the BD Ortho IGN. It is maintained by the SANDRE under free license for non-proﬁt use and downloadable at: http://services. sandre. eaufrance. fr/telechargement/geo/ETH/BDCarthage/FX From this shapeﬁle, we derived a raster containing the binary value of variable proxi_eau, i. e. proximity to fresh water, all over France. We used qgis to rasterize to a 12. 5 m resolution, with a buffer of 50 m, the shapeﬁle COURS_D_EAU. shp on one hand, and the polygons of *SURFACES_HYDROGRAPHIQUES. shp with attribute NATURE=“Eau douce permanente” on the other hand. We then created the maximum raster of the previous ones (So the value of 1 correspond to an approximate distance of less than 50 m to a watercourse or hydrographic surface of fresh water). 10. 2 Soil: European Soil Database v2. 0, 2004 The European Soil Database (ESDB) is a 1:1,000,000 scale digital soil map of Europe and adjacent countries. It was compiled at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission during the period 1985–2004. The ESDB is a harmonized soil database, which means that the soil information is organized in a standardized way. The ESDB is based on the Revised Legend of the FAO-UNESCO Soil Map of the World (FAO, 1988). The ESDB is a raster database, with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The ESDB is available in two versions: the ESDBv1 and the ESDBv2. The ESDBv2 is an update of the ESDBv1, which was released in 2004. The ESDBv2 is available for download at: http://esdac. jrc. ec. europa. eu/content/european-soil-database-v20 The ESDBv2 contains information on the following soil properties: soil texture, soil depth, soil organic carbon content, soil pH, soil cation exchange capacity, soil bulk density, soil available water capacity, soil hydraulic conductivity, soil erodibility, soil suitability for agriculture, soil suitability for forestry, soil suitability for nature conservation, soil suitability for urban development, soil suitability for recreation, soil suitability for tourism, soil

CQ11: What is the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF)?
Answer: The data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not provided in the given context. %Query

CQ12: What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?
Answer: The pipeline uses a deep feedforward network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) as deep learning models. The DNN has multiple hidden layers, and the CNN is composed of two hidden convolutional layers and one last layer fully connected with 200 neurons.

CQ13: What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?
Answer: The deep learning model was fitted with the package mxnet. The model parameters were initialized with a uniform distribution U (0. 03, 0. 03). A stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a momentum of 0. 9 was used. The batch-size was 50, with batch samples randomly chosen at each iteration. The initial learning rate was critical for good optimization behavior and was set to 10−. The learning rate was chosen to avoid training loss divergence when it was too big, and to prevent slow learning when it was too small. The learning took approximately 5 min for SNN, 10 min for DNN, and 5 h for CNN (independently of the version).

CQ14: How are the hyperparameters of the model optimized (e.g., grid search, random search)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.

CQ15: What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?
Answer: The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a momentum of 0. 9.

CQ16: What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?
Answer: The training is stopped when the average slope of the training mean loss has an absolute difference to 0 on the last 100 epochs.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The paper mentions the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. The paper also mentions the use of L2 regularization, which is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent the weights from becoming too large. This helps to prevent overfitting by making the model more generalizable.

CQ18: What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to stop when the average slope of the training mean loss had an absolute difference to 0 on the last 100 epochs. The learning took approximately 5 min for SNN, 10 min for DNN, and 5 h for CNN (independently of the version).

CQ19: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?
Answer: The experiments were conducted using the R framework (version 3. 3. 2). The deep learning models were built using the mxnet library, which is a C++ library for learning deep neural network models and is deployed as an R package. It integrates a high-level symbolic language for quickly building customized models and loss functions, and automatically distributes calculations under CPUs or GPUs.

CQ20: Which hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. %Query

CQ21: What are the postprocessing steps involved after the model training (e.g., Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix)?
Answer: After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are the calculation of performance metrics such as Mean Loss, Root Mean Square Error (Rmse), and Accuracy on 10% Densest Quadrats (A10%DQ). These metrics are calculated for each species and for two disjoints and randomly sampled subsets of sites: A train set (4781 sites) which is used for fitting all models and a test set (400 sites) which aims at testing models generalization capacities. Then, train and test metrics are averaged over the 50 species. The performance metrics are described in the following.

CQ22: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are Mean Loss, Root Mean Square Error (Rmse), and Accuracy on 10% Densest Quadrats (A10%DQ). These metrics are calculated for each species and for two disjoints and randomly sampled subsets of sites: A train set (4781 sites) which is used for ﬁtting all models and a test set (400 sites) which aims at testing models generalization capacities. Then, train and test metrics are averaged over the 50 species. The Mean loss is an important metric to consider because it is relevant regarding the ecological model and it is the objective function that is minimized during model training. The Root Mean Square Error (Rmse) is a general error measure, which, in contrary to the previous one, is independent of the statistical model. The Accuracy on 10% Densest Quadrats (A10%DQ) represents the proportion of sites which are in the top 10% of all sites in term of both real count and model prediction. This is a meaningful metric for many concrete scenarios where the regions of a territory have to be prioritized in terms of decision or actions related to the ecology of species.

CQ23: What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?
Answer: The generalizability of the deep learning model was tested by using a train set (4781 sites) for fitting all models and a test set (400 sites) for testing the models' generalization capacities. The performance metrics were calculated for each species and for the two disjoint and randomly sampled subsets of sites. The train and test metrics were then averaged over the 50 species.

CQ24: What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?
Answer: The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include using a fixed random seed value, using a deterministic algorithm, or using a combination of both. A fixed random seed value ensures that the same results are obtained each time the model is run, while a deterministic algorithm ensures that the same results are obtained regardless of the input data. A combination of both can be used to ensure that the model is both reproducible and robust. %Context 1. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. 2. Randomness is an inherent part of deep learning, as it is used to initialize the weights of the neural network and to select the training data. 3. To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, a fixed random seed value can be used to ensure that the same results are obtained each time the model is run. 4. Alternatively, a deterministic algorithm can be used to ensure that the same results are obtained regardless of the input data. 5. A combination of both can also be used to ensure that the model is both reproducible and robust. %Explanation The context provides information about the use of randomness in deep learning and the strategies employed to handle it. The query asks about the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The helpful answer is that the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include using a fixed random seed value, using a deterministic algorithm, or using a combination of both. This answer is helpful because it provides a clear and concise explanation of the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

CQ25: What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is to learn a function that takes the environmental feature vector of a given location as input and outputs an estimate of the abundance of the species. The main underlying hypothesis is that the abundance function is related to the fundamental ecological niche of the species, in the sense of Hutchinson. That means that in theory, a given species is likely to live in a single privileged ecological niche, characterized by an unimodal distribution in the environmental space. However, in reality, the abundance function is expected to be more complex. Many phenomena can actually affect the distribution of the species relative to its so called abiotic preferences. For instance, environment perturbations, or geographical constraints, or interactions with other living organisms (including humans) might have encourage specimens of that species to live in a different environment. As a consequence, the realized ecological niche of a species can be much more diverse and complex than its hypothetical fundamental niche.

CQ26: What techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection)?
Answer: Data bias can be addressed during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline using several techniques. Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that the distribution of the target variable is preserved in both the training and testing datasets. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in imbalanced datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating examples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing examples from the majority class. Diverse data collection is another approach to address data bias, which involves collecting data from a diverse range of sources to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular group or class.
