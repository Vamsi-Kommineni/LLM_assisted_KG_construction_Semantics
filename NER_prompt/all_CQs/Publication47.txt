CQ1: What methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., surveys, sensors, public datasets)?
Answer: The context does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that data was obtained from GBIF, which is a public dataset.

CQ2: What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the algorithm is based on digitally available occurrence records, which could suggest the use of structured data formats such as CSV or similar.

CQ3: What are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.

CQ4: What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question.

CQ5: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline used in this study is not based on common datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it uses a dataset of orchid species occurrence records, which includes features such as geographic, climatic, and biome data. The dataset was obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families (WCSP). The dataset was filtered to include only species with at least 15 occurrence records available for assessment and that were assessed under the IUCN Red List categories and criteria version 3. 1. The dataset was then split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%), with 20% of the training set used for validation.

CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved. These can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning of the data. Normalization is the process of rescaling the data to a standard range, often between 0 and 1, to ensure that all features have the same scale and do not dominate others. Scaling is a similar process, but it rescales the data to a specific range, such as -1 to 1. Cleaning the data involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the data set. These preprocessing steps are important to ensure that the model can accurately learn from the data and make reliable predictions.

CQ7: What are the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation)?
Answer: The data set was randomly split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%). Additionally, 20% of the training set was used for validation.

Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

CQ16: What criteria are used to determine when training is complete (e.g., validation loss plateau)?
Answer: The training is completed when the neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features is selected to predict the conservation status of all orchid species. Cross-validation is performed by shifting the validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

CQ18: What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. The data set was randomly split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%). 20% of the training set was used for validation. Cross-validation was performed by shifting the validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. The neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features was used to predict the conservation status of all orchid species.

CQ19: Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?

Answer: After the model training, the postprocessing steps involved are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is common to perform steps such as calculating metrics (e. g. , accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), creating a confusion matrix, and generating saliency maps to understand the model's performance and interpret its predictions.

CQ22: What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?
Answer: The performance of the deep learning model, IUC-NN, is evaluated using accuracy and cross-entropy loss. The accuracy is measured for both binary (possibly threatened vs. not threatened) and detailed (CR, EN, VU, NT, and LC) conservation status predictions. Cross-entropy loss is used to quantify the average validation loss during cross-validation.

CQ23: What measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (e.g., Diverse dataset, cross-validation, Stratified splitting)?
Answer: To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. The model was trained on a diverse dataset that included all species with an IUCN Red List assessment and available occurrence records. The data set was then randomly split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%). Additionally, 20% of the training set was used for validation. To further improve the model's generalizability, cross-validation was performed by shifting the validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. The neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features was then used to predict the conservation status of all orchid species.

CQ24: What strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., random seed value)?
Answer: The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed value, include setting a fixed seed value for reproducibility, using techniques like cross- validation to reduce the impact of randomness, and employing ensemble methods to combine the results of multiple models trained with different random seeds.

Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, IUC-NN, is to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species.
