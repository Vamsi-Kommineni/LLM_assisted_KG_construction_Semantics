The augmentations are applied using the MUDA library [30].

CQ5: What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)?
Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is the publicly available CLO-43SD dataset, which is comprised of 5428 audio clips of flight calls from 43 different species of North American wood- warblers.

CQ6: What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?
Answer: The context does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization involves scaling the input features to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling involves standardizing the input features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data.

We divide the CLO-43SD dataset into 5 folds and perform 5-fold cross validation, and report the results as a box- plot generated from the per-fold accuracies. For identifying the best training epoch for the CNN model we use 1 of the 4 training folds as a validation set, and train on the remaining 3 folds.

Answer: The model is trained for 100 epochs and is checkpointed after each epoch. A validation set is used to identify the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy. The best training epoch for the CNN model is identified using 1 of the 4 training folds as a validation set, and training on the remaining 3 folds.

CQ17: What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?
Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. Dropout is applied to the input of the last two layers with probability 0. 5, and L2-regularization is applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0. 001.

CQ25: What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is for classification. It is used to classify migrating birds' flight calls into different species. %Context 1. INTRODUCTION Automatic classification of animal vocalizations has great potential to enhance the monitoring of species movements and behaviors. This is particularly true for monitoring nocturnal bird migration, where automated classification of migrants' flight calls could yield new biological insights and conservation applications for birds that vocalize during migration. Among an increasingly important array of bioacoustic tools for conservation science [1] that describe presence, abundance, and behavior of vocal species, there is a significant body of research on automatic species classification from audio (e. g. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]). See [10] for a detailed survey of automatic birdsong recognition. Recently, a number of approaches have been proposed that employ generalizable machine learning techniques that can be easily adapted to multiple species [7, 11, 12]. However, these studies were focused on bird song (and marine mammals), not flight calls. Flight calls are species- specific vocalizations produced primarily during periods of sustained flight (i. e. , nocturnal migration). Among other differences from vocalizations analyzed in the aforementioned studies, flight calls are primarily single note vocalizations that are less than 200 ms long, whereas most songs contain several types of notes and may vary from seconds to minutes in duration. Studies focusing specifically on automated flight call classification include [13,14,15,16]. Automated classification of organisms to species based on their vocalizations would contribute tremendously to abilities to monitor biodiversity, with a wide range of applications in the field of ecology. In particular, automated classification of migrating birds' flight calls could yield new biological insights and conservation applications for birds that vocalize during migration. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art classification techniques for large-vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls. In particular, we contrast a "shallow learning" approach based on unsupervised dictionary learning with a deep convolutional neural network combined with data augmentation. We show that the two models perform comparably on a dataset of 5428 flight calls spanning 43 different species, with both significantly outperforming an MFCC baseline. Finally, we show that by combining the models using a simple late-fusion approach, we can further improve the results, obtaining a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 0. 96. %Query
