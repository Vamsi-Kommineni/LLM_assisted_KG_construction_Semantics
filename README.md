# LLM assisted KG construction
This repository contains code, data, prompts and results related to the (semi-)automatic pipeline of Ontology and Knowledge Graph Construction with four different Large Language Models (LLMs): Mixtral 8x22B Instruct v0.1-Instruct-v0.1, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Gemini.

## Overview
In this project, we explore the potential of utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This work explores the (semi-)automatic construction of KGs facilitated by different SOTA LLMs. Our pipeline involves formulating competency questions (CQs), developing an ontology (TBox) based on these CQs, constructing KGs using the developed ontology, and evaluating the resultant KG with minimal to no involvement of human experts. We showcase the feasibility of our semi-automated pipeline by creating a KG on deep learning methodologies by exploiting scholarly publications.

The repository encompasses various components, including code for data preprocessing, prompts used for LLMs, datasets employed in experiments, and the corresponding results obtained from four selected SOTA LLMs.
