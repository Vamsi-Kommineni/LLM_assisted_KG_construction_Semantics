2,"What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?","The deep learning pipeline in this context uses image data format. %Explanation Explanation: The context mentions that the deep learning pipeline uses image data format. It does not mention any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, the answer is that the deep learning pipeline in this context uses image data format. %Query ",TRUE
5,"What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? ","The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the GoogLeNet classifier was initialized with the pre-trained weights of ImageNet, which suggests that ImageNet was used as a dataset in the deep learning pipeline. ",TRUE
6,"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","The context does not provide information on the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, in general, preprocessing steps can include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation techniques such as random scale, random crop, flip horizontally, and random brightness.

12,"What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?","The pipeline uses a deep learning model called GoogLeNet, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). ",TRUE
15,"What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?","The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights in the deep learning pipeline. The network weights, wt, can be randomly initialized if the network is trained from scratch. However, this is suitable only when a large labeled training-set is available. Several works have shown that data-augmentation and transfer learning help overcome this limitation. Transfer learning (e. g. , fine-tuning in CNNs) consists of re-utilizing the knowledge learned from one problem to another related one. In deep CNNs, transfer learning can be applied via fine-tuning, which involves initializing the weights of the network by the pre-trained weights on a different dataset. ",TRUE
13,"What are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (e.g., learning rate, optimizer)?","The helpful answer is that the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights, and the network weights can be randomly initialized if the network is trained from scratch. Additionally, transfer learning (e. g. , fine-tuning in CNNs) is used to initialize the weights of the network by the pre-trained weights on a different dataset. ",TRUE
22,"What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?","The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using three metrics: precision (also called positive predictive value, i. e. , how many detected Ziziphus are true), recall (also known as sensitivity, i. , how many actual Ziziphus were detected), and F1 measure, which evaluates the balance between precision and recall. ",TRUE
17,"What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?","The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to prevent overfitting. ",Generalized
19,"Which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)?",The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow. %Explanation Explanation: The context mentions that TensorFlow is used for large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems.

8,"Where is the code repository of the deep learning pipeline available (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)?","The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact location of the code repository. ",TRUE
25,"What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?","The purpose of the deep learning model is for supervised classification. It is used to automatically discover increasingly higher level features from data. The lower convolutional layers capture low-level image features, e. g. edges, color, while higher convolutional layers capture more complex features, i. e. , composite of several features.
