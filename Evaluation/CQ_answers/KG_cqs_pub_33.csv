2,"What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?","The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are images. The images are extracted from videos and are coded as 3 matrices with numeric values describing the color component (R, G, B) of the pixel. ",TRUE
5,"What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? ","The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are T0, T1, and T2. T0 is the training dataset composed of 691,690 images, T1 is the dataset used to tune the thresholds containing 6,320 images, and T2 is the test dataset containing 13,232 images. These datasets are not standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but are specifically created for this study case to identify 20 fish species from underwater images on coral reefs. ",TRUE
6,"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","Before training the deep learning model, the images used to build the datasets were resized to 64 × 64 pixels. Additionally, data augmentation was used to improve the model. Each ""natural"" image yielded 4 more images: 2 with increased contrast (120% and 140%) and 2 with decreased contrast (80% and 60%). All images were then horizontally flipped to obtain the final training dataset. ",TRUE
4,"What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?","The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are increasing and decreasing contrast.

Additionally, all images were horizontally flipped to obtain the final training dataset. ",TRUE
12,"What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?",The pipeline uses a 100-layer CNN based on the TensorFlow implementation of ResNet.,TRUE
15,"What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?","The optimization of the parameters of the CNN is achieved during the training through a process called back-propagation. Back-propagation consists of automatically changing parameters of the CNN through the comparison between its output and the correct class of the training element to eventually improve the final classification rate. Here we used a 100-layer CNN based on the TensorFlow implementation of ResNet. The ResNet architecture achieved the best results on ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) in 2015, considered as the most challenging image classification competition. It is still one of the best classification algorithms, while being very easy to use and implement. All fish images extracted from the videos to build our datasets were resized to 64 × 64 pixels before being processed by the CNN. Our training procedure lasted 600,000 iterations; each iteration processed a batch of 16 images, which means that the 691,690 images of the training dataset were analyzed 14 times each by the network on average. We then stopped the training to prevent from overfitting, as an overfit model is too restrictive and only able to classify images that were used during the training. The context does not provide specific information on the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. However, it mentions that the optimization of the parameters of the CNN is achieved during the training through a process called back-propagation. The context also mentions the use of a 100-layer CNN based on the TensorFlow implementation of ResNet, which achieved the best results on ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) in 2015. The training procedure lasted 600,000 iterations, with each iteration processing a batch of 16 images. The training was stopped to prevent overfitting. ",TRUE

22,"What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?","The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the mean rate of correct classification of fish images in T2 by the raw CNN, which was found to be 78. 0%. The rates of correct classifications per species ranged from 54. 4% to 99. 1% (sd = 15. 16). These results serve as the baseline for further experiments. Additionally, images obtained softmax scores between 41 and 100, with 80% of images classified with a score between 60 and 100. The distribution of correct classifications and misclassifications among scores was highly variable among species. ",TRUE

25,"What is the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection)?","The purpose of the deep learning model is for classification, specifically for identifying fish species. The model is a 100-layer CNN based on the TensorFlow implementation of ResNet, which achieved the best results on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition in 2015. The model is used to classify fish images extracted from videos into 20 different fish species. The last layer of the architecture is a ""softmax"" layer, which converts image descriptors into a list of scores for each learned class, with the sum of all scores equal to 1. The class with the highest score is the predicted class for a given image. The model is trained on a given database and then a risk threshold is tuned for each class using a second and independent database. The goal is to transform the 2 classification options (correct, wrong) into 3 options by applying certain equations. The purpose of this is to accept or reject the classification decision of the CNN based on the similarity between an unknown image and the images used for training. The higher the similarity, the stronger the activation in the CNN during the classification process, and thus, the more robust the classification is. ",TRUE
