2,"What data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV)?","The context does not provide information on the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses satellite images as input data. %INSTRUCTIONS: Use the provided pieces of context to answer the query. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. %Query ",TRUE
5,"What are the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet)? ",The performance of the PTDLEN-VAE model is examined against UCM dataset and AID dataset. The UCM dataset comprises a set of 100 images with 21 class labels. Each image measures 256 Ã— 256 pixels. The pixel resolution of this public domain imagery is 1 ft. Fig. 1 showcases the sample images from UCM dataset. The AID multi-label dataset has 3000 RS images from the AID dataset.,TRUE
6,"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","The context does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, common preprocessing steps in deep learning include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization scales the data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1, to ensure that all features have the same scale. Scaling involves rescaling the data to a specific range, such as -1 to 1 or 0 to 1. Cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data. ",TRUE
4,"What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Fliping, Roating, Scaling)?","The context does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query. ",TRUE
12,"What type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer)?","The pipeline uses the EfficientNet model, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN). ",TRUE
15,"What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?","The helpful answer is that the paper does not explicitly mention the use of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the Improved Krill Herd Optimization (IKHO) algorithm for parameter optimization of the EfficientNet model. ",TRUE
